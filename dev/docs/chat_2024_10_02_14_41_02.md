Sure! Portfolio theory, also known as Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT), was developed by Harry Markowitz in the 1950s. The fundamental idea is to mix a variety of investments in such a way that you can maximize returns for a given level of risk, or minimize risk for a given level of expected return.

### Key Concepts of Portfolio Theory

1. **Risk and Return**: 
   - Every investment has a certain expected return and a certain level of risk (volatility).
   - Risk can be quantified by measuring the standard deviation of the returns.

2. **Diversification**:
   - By combining assets that do not move together (low correlation), you can reduce the overall risk of the portfolio.
   - For example, if one asset loses value when another gains, the overall effect on the portfolio can be minimized.

3. **Efficient Frontier**:
   - This is a graphical representation of a set of optimal portfolios that offer the highest expected return for a defined level of risk.
   - Portfolios that lie on the efficient frontier are considered optimal.

4. **Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)**:
   - This model is used in portfolio theory to determine the expected return on an asset based on its risk relative to the overall market.

### Steps to Understand and Prove Portfolio Theory

Let's break down the proof of portfolio theory step-by-step:

#### Step 1: Define the Portfolio

Suppose you have a portfolio composed of **N** assets. The weights of these assets in the portfolio are denoted by \( w_1, w_2, \ldots, w_N \) such that:

\[ \sum_{i=1}^{N} w_i = 1 \]

Each asset has an expected return \( r_i \) and variance \( \sigma_i^2 \).

#### Step 2: Calculate Expected Return and Risk of the Portfolio

1. **Expected Return**:
   The expected return \( E(R_p) \) of the portfolio is calculated as:

   \[
   E(R_p) = \sum_{i=1}^{N} w_i \cdot E(R_i)
   \]

2. **Variance of the Portfolio**:
   The variance \( \sigma_p^2 \) of the portfolio return accounts not only for the variances of the individual assets but also for the covariance between them:

   \[
   \sigma_p^2 = \sum_{i=1}^{N} \sum_{j=1}^{N} w_i w_j \text{Cov}(R_i, R_j)
   \]

   Where \( \text{Cov}(R_i, R_j) \) is the covariance between the returns of assets \( i \) and \( j \).

#### Step 3: Minimize Risk for a Given Return

Using calculus, one can derive the optimal weights \( w_i \) that minimize the variance \( \sigma_p^2 \) subject to the constraint that \( E(R_p) \) meets a target return.

#### Step 4: The Efficient Frontier

Plotting the expected return against risk (standard deviation) for a range of portfolios gives you the efficient frontier. Any portfolio on this curve is considered efficient, meaning you cannot have a higher return without taking on more risk.

#### Step 5: Capital Market Line (CML)

In the context of the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM), the relationship between risk and return can be efficiently represented using the CML, which shows the risk-return trade-off for efficient portfolios.

### Conclusion

By understanding the relationships between risk and return, the effects of diversification, and how to construct optimal portfolios, you can use portfolio theory to make informed investment decisions.

While this is a simplified explanation, you can dive deeper into topics like covariance, correlation, and the mathematical proofs behind the calculations as you grow more comfortable with the concepts.
