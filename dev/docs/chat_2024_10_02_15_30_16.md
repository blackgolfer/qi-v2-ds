QuantConnectâ€™s Lean is an open-source algorithmic trading engine that allows you to develop, backtest, and deploy trading strategies. Below is a step-by-step guide for setting up / using Lean locally with a simple strategy using the MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence) indicator.

### Step 1: Set Up Your Environment

1. **Install Git and Docker**:
   - Ensure you have [Git](https://git-scm.com/) installed on your machine.
   - Install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) as Lean runs inside a Docker container.

2. **Clone the Lean Algorithm Framework**:
   - Open a terminal and run the following command to clone the Lean GitHub repository:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/QuantConnect/Lean.git
     ```
   - Navigate to the cloned directory:
     ```bash
     cd Lean
     ```

3. **Build the Docker Image**:
   - To build the Docker image, run:
     ```bash
     docker build -t quantconnect/lean .
     ```
   - This may take some time as it pulls the necessary dependencies.

### Step 2: Create Your Trading Strategy

1. **Create a New Algorithm Folder**:
   - Navigate to the `Algorithm.CSharp` directory or create your own under `Algorithm.Python` for Python-based strategies.
   - You can create a new folder for your algorithm, e.g., `MyMACDStrategy`.

2. **Create a Python File for Your Strategy**:
   - Inside your new folder, create a Python file, e.g., `macd_strategy.py`.

3. **Write the MACD Strategy Code**:
   - Here's a simple example strategy using the MACD indicator:

```python
from AlgorithmImports import *

class MyMACDStrategy(QCAlgorithm):

    def Initialize(self):
        self.SetStartDate(2021, 1, 1)    # Set Start Date
        self.SetEndDate(2023, 1, 1)      # Set End Date
        self.SetCash(10000)               # Set Strategy Cash
        self.AddEquity("AAPL", Resolution.Daily)  # Add equity security

        # MACD indicator settings
        self.macd = self.MACD("AAPL", 12, 26, 9, MovingAverageType.Wilders, Resolution.Daily, Field.Close)

    def OnData(self, data):
        if not self.macd.IsReady:
            return

        # Buy Signal: when the MACD line crosses above the signal line
        if self.macd.Current.Value > self.macd.Signal.Current.Value and not self.Portfolio.Invested:
            self.SetHoldings("AAPL", 1)  # Invest 100% of the portfolio
        # Sell Signal: when the MACD line crosses below the signal line
        elif self.macd.Current.Value < self.macd.Signal.Current.Value and self.Portfolio.Invested:
            self.Liquidate("AAPL")  # Liquidate the position
```

### Step 3: Running the Strategy

1. **Create a Docker Container** (if not already running):
   - Open a terminal and run:
     ```bash
     docker run -it --rm -v $(pwd):/Lean/Algorithm -p 8888:8888 quantconnect/lean
     ```

2. **Access the Lean CLI**:
   - After running the container, you can execute commands to backtest or run your algorithm.

3. **Run Your Strategy**:
   - In the Lean CLI, navigate to the directory where your `macd_strategy.py` is located.
   - To run the strategy, you use the following command:
     ```bash
     python macd_strategy.py
     ```

### Step 4: Interpreting Results

- After running your strategy, Lean will produce a results file (typically in the `/Results` directory). You can check performance, trades, and other metrics through the generated report.
- Look for key indicators such as:
  - Total Return
  - Number of Trades
  - Win Rate

### Conclusion

You now have a basic setup and understanding of how to create a simple MACD trading strategy using QuantConnect's Lean in your local environment. You can modify the parameters or add more features to enhance your strategy.
