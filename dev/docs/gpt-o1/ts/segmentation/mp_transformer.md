## 3. Understanding the Concepts

### 3.1. Time-Series Segmentation

**Time-Series Segmentation** involves dividing a time-series dataset into homogeneous segments where each segment represents a consistent state or regime. In cryptocurrency trading, this could mean identifying periods of high volatility, steady trends, consolidation phases, etc. Effective segmentation aids in:

- **Enhancing Predictive Models**: By focusing on specific regimes.
- **Anomaly Detection**: Identifying unusual behaviors.
- **Strategic Decision Making**: Tailoring strategies based on current market conditions.

### 3.2. Multi-Time-Scale Analysis

**Multi-Time-Scale Analysis** examines data at various temporal resolutions to capture both short-term fluctuations and long-term trends. For example:

- **Short-Term (1-5 minutes)**: Capturing high-frequency trading patterns, micro-trends.
- **Medium-Term (15-60 minutes)**: Identifying intra-day trends, pivot points.
- **Long-Term (1 day+)**: Understanding broader market trends, macroeconomic influences.

Analyzing multiple time scales provides a comprehensive view, allowing models to recognize patterns that manifest differently across time horizons.

### 3.3. Finite State Machines (FSM)

A **Finite State Machine (FSM)** is a computational model used to design algorithms based on states and transitions. In time-series segmentation:

- **States**: Represent different market regimes (e.g., Bullish, Bearish, Consolidation).
- **Transitions**: Triggered by changes in data patterns, signaling a shift from one state to another.

**Multiple Time-Scale FSM** involves managing FSMs operating at different time scales simultaneously, enhancing the model's ability to capture complex market dynamics.

### 3.4. Matching Pursuit

**Matching Pursuit (MP)** is a greedy algorithm used for signal decomposition. It iteratively selects the waveform (atom) from a predefined dictionary that best matches the current signal and subtracts it, continuing until the signal is sufficiently approximated.

**Applications in Time-Series Analysis**:

- **Feature Extraction**: Represent time-series data as a combination of basis functions.
- **Noise Reduction**: Isolate significant patterns by removing noise components.
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identify recurring patterns or anomalous behaviors.

**Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP)**, available in scikit-learn, is a refined version that ensures orthogonality among selected atoms, enhancing stability and performance.

### 3.5. Transformer Models & GPT

**Transformer Models** are deep learning architectures that leverage self-attention mechanisms to process sequential data effectively. **GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer)** is a variant focused on generating coherent and contextually relevant sequences.

**Key Features**:

- **Self-Attention**: Captures dependencies across different parts of the input sequence.
- **Scalability**: Efficiently handles large datasets and long sequences.
- **Versatility**: Applicable to various sequential tasks beyond NLP, including time-series forecasting and segmentation.

**GPT's Adaptability**:

While GPT is primarily designed for language tasks, its architecture can be adapted to handle numerical sequences by redefining tokens and embedding strategies.

## 4. Step 1: Data Collection and Preparation

### 4.1. Collecting OHLC Data

**OHLC (Open, High, Low, Close) Data** is fundamental for analyzing financial markets, including cryptocurrencies. It provides insights into price movements and market sentiment.

**Using `ccxt` to Fetch Data from Binance:**

```python
import ccxt
import pandas as pd

def fetch_ohlc_data(exchange_name='binance', symbol='BTC/USDT', timeframe='1m', since=None, limit=1000):
    exchange = getattr(ccxt, exchange_name)()
    ohlcv = exchange.fetch_ohlcv(symbol, timeframe=timeframe, since=since, limit=limit)
    df = pd.DataFrame(ohlcv, columns=['timestamp', 'open', 'high', 'low', 'close', 'volume'])
    df['timestamp'] = pd.to_datetime(df['timestamp'], unit='ms')
    return df

# Example usage
df_1m = fetch_ohlc_data(timeframe='1m', limit=5000)
print(df_1m.head())
```

**Notes:**

- **Timeframe**: Adjust the `timeframe` parameter (`'1m'`, `'5m'`, `'15m'`, `'1h'`, etc.) based on your analysis needs.
- **Limit and Since**: Control the amount of data fetched. Incremental fetching based on the `since` timestamp ensures up-to-date data.

### 4.2. Aggregating Data Across Multiple Time Scales

To perform multi-time-scale analysis, resample your OHLC data to different timeframes.

**Function to Resample OHLC Data:**

```python
def resample_ohlc(df, timeframe='5T'):
    resampled_df = df.resample(timeframe, on='timestamp').agg({
        'open': 'first',
        'high': 'max',
        'low': 'min',
        'close': 'last',
        'volume': 'sum'
    }).dropna()
    return resampled_df

# Resample to 5-minute intervals
df_5m = resample_ohlc(df_1m, '5T')

# Resample to 15-minute intervals
df_15m = resample_ohlc(df_1m, '15T')

# Resample to 1-hour intervals
df_1h = resample_ohlc(df_1m, '1H')

print(df_5m.head())
print(df_15m.head())
print(df_1h.head())
```

**Explanation:**

- **Timeframe Codes**: `'1T'` for 1-minute, `'5T'` for 5-minute, `'15T'` for 15-minute, `'1H'` for 1-hour, etc.
- **Aggregation**: Defines how to aggregate each OHLC field during resampling.

### 4.3. Feature Engineering

Enhancing your dataset with additional features can improve the model's predictive capabilities.

**Calculating Technical Indicators Using `ta` Library:**

```python
import ta

def add_technical_indicators(df):
    # Calculate 14-period RSI
    df['rsi'] = ta.momentum.RSIIndicator(close=df['close'], window=14).rsi()
    
    # Calculate 50-period Simple Moving Average
    df['sma_50'] = ta.trend.SMAIndicator(close=df['close'], window=50).sma_indicator()
    
    # Calculate 200-period Simple Moving Average
    df['sma_200'] = ta.trend.SMAIndicator(close=df['close'], window=200).sma_indicator()
    
    # Calculate MACD
    macd = ta.trend.MACD(close=df['close'])
    df['macd'] = macd.macd()
    df['macd_signal'] = macd.macd_signal()
    df['macd_diff'] = macd.macd_diff()
    
    # Calculate Bollinger Bands
    bollinger = ta.volatility.BollingerBands(close=df['close'], window=20, window_dev=2)
    df['bb_bbm'] = bollinger.bollinger_mavg()
    df['bb_bbh'] = bollinger.bollinger_hband()
    df['bb_bbl'] = bollinger.bollinger_lband()
    
    # Drop rows with NaN values resulting from indicator calculations
    df = df.dropna()
    
    return df

# Apply feature engineering
df_5m = add_technical_indicators(df_5m)
df_15m = add_technical_indicators(df_15m)
df_1h = add_technical_indicators(df_1h)

print(df_5m.head())
print(df_15m.head())
print(df_1h.head())
```

**Notes:**

- **Technical Indicators**: Provide insights into market momentum, trend strength, volatility, and potential reversal points.
- **Library Installation**: Install the `ta` library using `pip install ta`.

### 4.4. Data Normalization

Normalizing data ensures that features contribute equally to the model's learning process, preventing biases due to differing scales.

**Using Min-Max Scaling with Scikit-learn:**

```python
from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler

def normalize_features(df, feature_columns):
    scaler = MinMaxScaler()
    df_scaled = df.copy()
    df_scaled[feature_columns] = scaler.fit_transform(df[feature_columns])
    return df_scaled, scaler

# Define features to normalize
features_5m = ['open', 'high', 'low', 'close', 'volume', 'rsi', 'sma_50', 'sma_200', 'macd', 'macd_signal', 'macd_diff', 'bb_bbm', 'bb_bbh', 'bb_bbl']
features_15m = ['open', 'high', 'low', 'close', 'volume', 'rsi', 'sma_50', 'sma_200', 'macd', 'macd_signal', 'macd_diff', 'bb_bbm', 'bb_bbh', 'bb_bbl']
features_1h = ['open', 'high', 'low', 'close', 'volume', 'rsi', 'sma_50', 'sma_200', 'macd', 'macd_signal', 'macd_diff', 'bb_bbm', 'bb_bbh', 'bb_bbl']

df_5m_scaled, scaler_5m = normalize_features(df_5m, features_5m)
df_15m_scaled, scaler_15m = normalize_features(df_15m, features_15m)
df_1h_scaled, scaler_1h = normalize_features(df_1h, features_1h)

print(df_5m_scaled.head())
print(df_15m_scaled.head())
print(df_1h_scaled.head())
```

### 4.5. Creating Training and Testing Datasets

Splitting data into training and testing sets is essential for evaluating model performance objectively.

```python
def train_test_split(df, test_size=0.2):
    split_idx = int(len(df) * (1 - test_size))
    train = df.iloc[:split_idx]
    test = df.iloc[split_idx:]
    return train, test

# Split data
train_5m, test_5m = train_test_split(df_5m_scaled, test_size=0.2)
train_15m, test_15m = train_test_split(df_15m_scaled, test_size=0.2)
train_1h, test_1h = train_test_split(df_1h_scaled, test_size=0.2)

print(f"5-Min Training Data: {train_5m.shape}")
print(f"5-Min Testing Data: {test_5m.shape}")
print(f"15-Min Training Data: {train_15m.shape}")
print(f"15-Min Testing Data: {test_15m.shape}")
print(f"1-Hour Training Data: {train_1h.shape}")
print(f"1-Hour Testing Data: {test_1h.shape}")
```

## 5. Step 2: Applying Matching Pursuit

**Matching Pursuit (MP)** is an algorithm used for signal decomposition, representing a signal as a linear combination of waveforms (atoms) from a predefined dictionary. This decomposition is beneficial for feature extraction, noise reduction, and pattern recognition in time-series data.

In this context, we'll use **Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP)** from Scikit-learn as a proxy for MP due to its availability and efficiency.

### 5.1. Understanding Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP)

**Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP)** is a sparse approximation algorithm that sequentially selects dictionary atoms to best represent the input signal. It ensures orthogonality between the residual and the selected atoms, enhancing stability and performance.

**Key Features:**

- **Sparsity**: Represents signals using a minimal number of atoms.
- **Efficiency**: Faster convergence compared to greedy algorithms.
- **Reconstruction**: Ability to reconstruct signals with high fidelity.

### 5.2. Implementing Matching Pursuit in Python

Since Python lacks a direct Matching Pursuit library, we'll use Scikit-learn's OMP as an alternative.

**Implementing OMP for Signal Decomposition:**

```python
from sklearn.linear_model import OrthogonalMatchingPursuit
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

def orthogonal_matching_pursuit(signal, n_nonzero_coefs=10, max_iter=1000):
    # Define a dictionary (e.g., sine and cosine waves at various frequencies)
    n_samples = len(signal)
    t = np.linspace(0, 1, n_samples)
    freqs = np.linspace(1, 50, 100)  # 100 frequencies from 1 to 50 Hz
    dictionary = []
    for freq in freqs:
        dictionary.append(np.sin(2 * np.pi * freq * t))
        dictionary.append(np.cos(2 * np.pi * freq * t))
    dictionary = np.array(dictionary).T  # Shape: (n_samples, n_features)
    
    # Normalize dictionary atoms
    dictionary /= np.linalg.norm(dictionary, axis=0)
    
    # Apply OMP
    omp = OrthogonalMatchingPursuit(n_nonzero_coefs=n_nonzero_coefs, max_iter=max_iter)
    omp.fit(dictionary, signal)
    coef = omp.coef_
    
    # Reconstruct the signal
    reconstructed_signal = dictionary @ coef
    
    return reconstructed_signal, coef, dictionary

# Example usage: Apply to the 'close' price of 5-minute data
signal_5m = train_5m_scaled['close'].values  # Replace 'close' with desired feature

reconstructed_signal_5m, coef_5m, dictionary_5m = orthogonal_matching_pursuit(signal_5m, n_nonzero_coefs=10)

# Plot original and reconstructed signals
plt.figure(figsize=(14, 7))
plt.plot(signal_5m, label='Original Signal')
plt.plot(reconstructed_signal_5m, label='Reconstructed Signal', linestyle='--')
plt.legend()
plt.title('Orthogonal Matching Pursuit Reconstruction')
plt.show()
```

**Explanation:**

- **Dictionary Definition**: Creating a set of sine and cosine waves at various frequencies to serve as atoms. Adjust frequencies based on the nature of your data.
- **Normalization**: Ensures each atom has unit norm, facilitating better matching.
- **OMP Application**: Selects the most significant atoms that can reconstruct the signal with minimal error.
- **Reconstruction**: Combines selected atoms to approximate the original signal.

### 5.3. Feature Extraction Using Matching Pursuit

The coefficients obtained from OMP represent the signal's projection onto the dictionary atoms. These coefficients can be used as features for the Transformer model.

**Integrating OMP into Feature Extraction Pipeline:**

```python
def extract_matching_pursuit_features(df, feature_columns, n_nonzero_coefs=10):
    feature_dict = {}
    for feature in feature_columns:
        signal = df[feature].values
        reconstructed_signal, coef, dictionary = orthogonal_matching_pursuit(signal, n_nonzero_coefs=n_nonzero_coefs)
        # Store coefficients as features
        for i in range(len(coef)):
            feature_dict[f'{feature}_coef_{i}'] = coef[i]
    # Convert to DataFrame
    features_df = pd.DataFrame(feature_dict).transpose().reset_index(drop=True)
    return features_df

# Apply feature extraction to training and testing data

features_train_5m = extract_matching_pursuit_features(train_5m_scaled, features_5m, n_nonzero_coefs=10)
features_test_5m = extract_matching_pursuit_features(test_5m_scaled, features_5m, n_nonzero_coefs=10)

features_train_15m = extract_matching_pursuit_features(train_15m_scaled, features_15m, n_nonzero_coefs=10)
features_test_15m = extract_matching_pursuit_features(test_15m_scaled, features_15m, n_nonzero_coefs=10)

features_train_1h = extract_matching_pursuit_features(train_1h_scaled, features_1h, n_nonzero_coefs=10)
features_test_1h = extract_matching_pursuit_features(test_1h_scaled, features_1h, n_nonzero_coefs=10)

print(features_train_5m.head())
print(features_test_5m.head())
```

**Notes:**

- **Feature Naming**: Each coefficient is named systematically (e.g., `close_coef_0`, `close_coef_1`, ...).
- **Dimensionality**: Adjust `n_nonzero_coefs` based on the desired feature richness and computational constraints.

---

## 6. Step 3: Designing the Transformer Model

With the Matching Pursuit features extracted, the next step is to design a Transformer-based model tailored for time-series segmentation.

### 6.1. Selecting the Right Transformer Architecture

**Transformer Architectures** vary based on their intended tasks:

- **Encoder-Only (e.g., BERT)**: Suitable for understanding input sequences, useful for tasks like classification and segmentation.
- **Decoder-Only (e.g., GPT)**: Geared towards generating sequences, useful for forecasting and generative tasks.
- **Encoder-Decoder (e.g., T5)**: Combines both capabilities, suitable for sequence-to-sequence tasks.

**Recommendation**:

- **Encoder-Only Transformers** are ideal for segmentation tasks since they excel at understanding and classifying input sequences.
- For forecasting, **Decoder-Only Transformers** like GPT can be adapted by treating future time steps as tokens to predict.

### 6.2. Adapting GPT for Time-Series Forecasting

While GPT is designed for text generation, its **autoregressive** nature can be harnessed for forecasting numerical sequences.

**Key Adaptations**:

1. **Input Representation**: Convert numerical time-series data into a token-like format.
2. **Output Generation**: Instead of generating text, predict future numerical values or labels indicating segmentation points.

### 6.3. Handling Multiple Time Scales in the Model

Incorporate multiple time scales by:

- **Concatenating Features**: Combine Matching Pursuit features from different time scales into a single feature vector.
- **Hierarchical Modeling**: Use separate Transformer layers for each time scale and merge their outputs.
- **Multi-Head Attention**: Design attention heads to focus on different time scales.

**Recommendation**:

Start with **Feature Concatenation**, as it's simpler and effective for capturing multi-scale information.

**Example Feature Vector Structure**:

```
[5m_coef_0, 5m_coef_1, ..., 15m_coef_0, 15m_coef_1, ..., 1h_coef_0, 1h_coef_1, ...]
```

---

## 7. Step 4: Integrating Matching Pursuit Features with Transformer

This step involves preparing the extracted features for the Transformer model, defining the model architecture, and setting up the training pipeline.

### 7.1. Preparing the Data for the Transformer

**Sequence Construction**:

- **Input Sequence**: A window of feature vectors over a specified sequence length.
- **Target**: The segment label or the next value to predict.

**Function to Create Sequences:**

```python
import numpy as np

def create_sequences(features_df, targets, seq_length=30):
    sequences = []
    target_labels = []
    for i in range(len(features_df) - seq_length):
        seq = features_df.iloc[i:i+seq_length].values
        target = targets.iloc[i+seq_length]
        sequences.append(seq)
        target_labels.append(target)
    return np.array(sequences), np.array(target_labels)

# Define target as 'close' price or segmentation labels
# For segmentation, define a label based on state transitions
# Example: Encode states as integers (e.g., 0: Bearish, 1: Bullish, 2: Consolidation)

# Placeholder: Assume 'state' column exists in data
# For demonstration, create synthetic state labels
train_5m_scaled['state'] = np.random.choice([0, 1, 2], size=len(train_5m_scaled))
test_5m_scaled['state'] = np.random.choice([0, 1, 2], size=len(test_5m_scaled))

# Create sequences for 5-minute data
X_train_5m, y_train_5m = create_sequences(features_train_5m, train_5m_scaled['state'], seq_length=30)
X_test_5m, y_test_5m = create_sequences(features_test_5m, test_5m_scaled['state'], seq_length=30)

# Similarly, create for other time scales if needed
```

**Notes:**

- **Sequence Length**: Determines how many past time steps the model considers. Adjust based on data characteristics.
- **Target Definition**: For segmentation, targets are categorical labels indicating the current state.

### 7.2. Building the Transformer Model with PyTorch

**Example: Encoder-Only Transformer for Segmentation**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
from torch.utils.data import Dataset, DataLoader

class TimeSeriesDataset(Dataset):
    def __init__(self, sequences, labels):
        self.X = torch.tensor(sequences, dtype=torch.float32)
        self.y = torch.tensor(labels, dtype=torch.long)  # Categorical labels
    
    def __len__(self):
        return len(self.X)
    
    def __getitem__(self, idx):
        return self.X[idx], self.y[idx]

# Create Datasets and DataLoaders
batch_size = 64
train_dataset = TimeSeriesDataset(X_train_5m, y_train_5m)
test_dataset = TimeSeriesDataset(X_test_5m, y_test_5m)

train_loader = DataLoader(train_dataset, batch_size=batch_size, shuffle=True)
test_loader = DataLoader(test_dataset, batch_size=batch_size, shuffle=False)

# Define the Transformer-based Segmentation Model
class TransformerSegmenter(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_dim, model_dim=256, num_heads=4, num_layers=3, num_classes=3, dropout=0.1):
        super(TransformerSegmenter, self).__init__()
        
        self.input_embedding = nn.Linear(input_dim, model_dim)
        self.positional_encoding = nn.Parameter(torch.zeros(1, 500, model_dim))  # Adjust sequence length as needed
        
        encoder_layer = nn.TransformerEncoderLayer(d_model=model_dim, nhead=num_heads, dropout=dropout)
        self.transformer_encoder = nn.TransformerEncoder(encoder_layer, num_layers=num_layers)
        
        self.fc = nn.Linear(model_dim, num_classes)
        self.dropout = nn.Dropout(dropout)
    
    def forward(self, x):
        # x shape: (batch_size, seq_length, input_dim)
        x = self.input_embedding(x)  # (batch_size, seq_length, model_dim)
        x = x + self.positional_encoding[:, :x.size(1), :]  # Add positional encoding
        x = x.permute(1, 0, 2)  # (seq_length, batch_size, model_dim)
        x = self.transformer_encoder(x)  # (seq_length, batch_size, model_dim)
        x = x[-1, :, :]  # Take the output of the last time step
        x = self.dropout(x)
        x = self.fc(x)  # (batch_size, num_classes)
        return x

# Initialize the model
input_dim = X_train_5m.shape[2]  # Number of features
num_classes = 3  # Number of segmentation states
model = TransformerSegmenter(input_dim=input_dim, num_classes=num_classes)

# Move model to GPU if available
device = torch.device('cuda' if torch.cuda.is_available() else 'cpu')
model = model.to(device)

# Define Loss and Optimizer
criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()
optimizer = torch.optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.001)
```

### 7.3. Training the Transformer Model

Implement the training loop with evaluation.

```python
num_epochs = 20

for epoch in range(num_epochs):
    model.train()
    epoch_loss = 0
    correct = 0

    print(f"Test Loss: {avg_test_loss:.4f} - Test Accuracy: {test_accuracy:.2f}%\n")
```

**Notes:**

- **CrossEntropyLoss**: Suitable for multi-class classification tasks.
- **Accuracy Tracking**: Provides insight into the model's performance over epochs.
- **Evaluation Phase**: Ensures the model generalizes well to unseen data.

---

## 8. Step 5: Evaluation

Evaluating your model ensures it performs as expected and generalizes well to new, unseen data.

### 8.1. Defining Evaluation Metrics

**Common Metrics for Segmentation:**

- **Accuracy**: Percentage of correctly predicted segments.
- **Precision, Recall, F1-Score**: For class-wise performance.
- **Confusion Matrix**: Visual representation of prediction vs. actual labels.

**Example: Computing Evaluation Metrics**

```python
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, classification_report, confusion_matrix
import seaborn as sns

def evaluate_model(model, data_loader):
    model.eval()
    all_preds = []
    all_labels = []
    
    with torch.no_grad():
        for batch_x, batch_y in data_loader:
            batch_x = batch_x.to(device)
            outputs = model(batch_x)
            _, predicted = torch.max(outputs.data, 1)
            all_preds.extend(predicted.cpu().numpy())
            all_labels.extend(batch_y.cpu().numpy())
    
    acc = accuracy_score(all_labels, all_preds)
    report = classification_report(all_labels, all_preds, target_names=['Bearish', 'Bullish', 'Consolidation'])
    cm = confusion_matrix(all_labels, all_preds)
    
    print(f"Accuracy: {acc * 100:.2f}%")
    print("Classification Report:")
    print(report)
    
    # Plot Confusion Matrix
    sns.heatmap(cm, annot=True, fmt='d', cmap='Blues', xticklabels=['Bearish', 'Bullish', 'Consolidation'], yticklabels=['Bearish', 'Bullish', 'Consolidation'])
    plt.xlabel('Predicted')
    plt.ylabel('Actual')
    plt.title('Confusion Matrix')
    plt.show()

# Evaluate on Test Set
evaluate_model(model, test_loader)
```

### 8.2. Performing Backtesting

**Backtesting** involves testing your segmentation and subsequent trading strategies on historical data to evaluate their performance.

**Steps:**

1. **Define Trading Rules**: Based on identified segmentation states (e.g., buy during Bullish, sell during Bearish).
2. **Simulate Trades**: Apply the rules on historical data.
3. **Compute Performance Metrics**: ROI, Sharpe Ratio, Maximum Drawdown, etc.

**Example: Simple Backtesting Framework**

```python
def backtest_strategy(df, segments):
    """
    df: Original dataframe with OHLC data.
    segments: Array of segmentation labels aligned with df's indices.
    """
    initial_capital = 10000
    capital = initial_capital
    position = 0  # 0: No position, 1: Long
    
    portfolio = []
    
    for i in range(len(segments)):
        state = segments[i]
        price = df.iloc[i]['close']
        
        if state == 1 and position == 0:  # Bullish: Buy
            position = capital / price
            capital = 0
            print(f"Buy at {price} on index {i}")
        
        elif state == 0 and position > 0:  # Bearish: Sell
            capital = position * price
            position = 0
            print(f"Sell at {price} on index {i}")
        
        # Record portfolio value
        total_value = capital + (position * price if position > 0 else 0)
        portfolio.append(total_value)
    
    # Calculate ROI
    roi = (portfolio[-1] - initial_capital) / initial_capital * 100
    print(f"Final ROI: {roi:.2f}%")
    
    # Plot Portfolio Growth
    plt.figure(figsize=(14, 7))
    plt.plot(portfolio, label='Portfolio Value')
    plt.axhline(initial_capital, color='r', linestyle='--', label='Initial Capital')
    plt.legend()
    plt.title('Backtesting Portfolio Growth')
    plt.xlabel('Time Index')
    plt.ylabel('Portfolio Value ($)')
    plt.show()

# Example Backtest using Test Set Segments
# Align segments with test set
segments_test_5m = y_test_5m  # Replace with actual segment predictions if different
backtest_strategy(test_5m_scaled, segments_test_5m)
```

**Notes:**

- **Trading Rules**: Can be more sophisticated, incorporating stop-loss, take-profit, and position sizing.
- **Performance Metrics**: Sharpe Ratio, Max Drawdown, Win Rate, etc., provide deeper insights into strategy robustness.

### 8.3. Analyzing Model Performance

Beyond basic metrics, analyze:

- **Confusion Matrix**: Understand where the model is misclassifying.
- **Temporal Analysis**: Check if misclassifications occur during specific market conditions.
- **Statistical Significance**: Ensure improvements aren't due to random chance.

**Visualization Example:**

Plotting segmentation states over time alongside actual price movements.

```python
def plot_segmentation(df, segments):
    df_plot = df.iloc[30:].copy()  # Adjust based on sequence length
    df_plot['segment'] = segments
    
    plt.figure(figsize=(14, 7))
    plt.plot(df_plot['close'], label='Close Price')
    
    # Shade background based on segments
    for state in df_plot['segment'].unique():
        subset = df_plot[df_plot['segment'] == state]
        plt.scatter(subset.index, subset['close'], label=f'State {state}')
    
    plt.legend()
    plt.title('Time-Series Segmentation')
    plt.xlabel('Time Index')
    plt.ylabel('Close Price')
    plt.show()

# Plot segmentation
plot_segmentation(test_5m_scaled, segments_test_5m)
```

---

## 9. Step 6: Deployment

Deploying your model enables real-time segmentation and integration into trading systems.

### 9.1. Saving and Loading the Model

**Saving the Trained Model:**

```python
import torch

# Save the model's state dictionary
torch.save(model.state_dict(), 'transformer_segmenter.pth')
```

**Loading the Trained Model:**

```python
# Initialize the model architecture
model = TransformerSegmenter(input_dim=input_dim, num_classes=num_classes)
model.load_state_dict(torch.load('transformer_segmenter.pth'))
model = model.to(device)
model.eval()
```

### 9.2. Setting Up a Prediction API

Creating an API allows external applications to query the model for segmentation.

**Using FastAPI for the Prediction API:**

1. **Install FastAPI and Uvicorn:**

    ```bash
    pip install fastapi uvicorn
    ```

2. **Create `api.py`:**

    ```python
    # api.py

    from fastapi import FastAPI, HTTPException
    from pydantic import BaseModel
    import torch
    import numpy as np

    app = FastAPI()

    # Define the input schema
    class PredictionRequest(BaseModel):
        sequence: list  # List of lists representing feature vectors

    # Load the trained model
    device = torch.device('cuda' if torch.cuda.is_available() else 'cpu')
    model = TransformerSegmenter(input_dim=input_dim, num_classes=num_classes)
    model.load_state_dict(torch.load('transformer_segmenter.pth'))
    model = model.to(device)
    model.eval()

    @app.post("/predict")
    async def predict_segment(request: PredictionRequest):
        try:
            # Convert input sequence to tensor
            sequence = np.array(request.sequence)
            if sequence.shape != (seq_length, input_dim):
                raise ValueError(f"Expected sequence shape ({seq_length}, {input_dim}), but got {sequence.shape}")
            sequence_tensor = torch.tensor(sequence, dtype=torch.float32).unsqueeze(0).to(device)
            
            # Make prediction
            with torch.no_grad():
                output = model(sequence_tensor)
                _, predicted = torch.max(output, 1)
            
            return {"predicted_segment": int(predicted.item())}
        
        except Exception as e:
            raise HTTPException(status_code=400, detail=str(e))
    ```

3. **Run the API Server:**

    ```bash
    uvicorn api:app --reload
    ```

**Note:**

- **Security**: Implement authentication and rate limiting to protect your API.
- **Validation**: Ensure rigorous input validation to prevent malformed requests.

### 9.3. Real-Time Data Integration

Integrate the deployed model into a real-time trading system.

**Example Workflow:**

1. **Data Streaming**: Set up a pipeline to receive live OHLC data (e.g., via WebSocket).
2. **Preprocessing**: Apply the same preprocessing steps (Aggregation, Feature Engineering, Normalization, Matching Pursuit).
3. **Segmentation**: Send processed sequences to the prediction API to receive segment labels.
4. **Trading Logic**: Implement strategies based on segmentation (e.g., enter long on Bullish, exit on Bearish).
5. **Execution**: Interface with trading platforms to execute trades automatically.

**Pseudo-Code Example:**

```python
import requests
import time

def fetch_live_data():
    # Implement data fetching logic (e.g., WebSocket or REST API calls)
    pass

def preprocess_live_data(latest_data):
    # Apply Aggregation, Feature Engineering, Normalization, Matching Pursuit
    pass

def get_segment_label(sequence):
    response = requests.post("http://localhost:8000/predict", json={"sequence": sequence.tolist()})
    if response.status_code == 200:
        return response.json()['predicted_segment']
    else:
        raise Exception("API request failed")

def trading_strategy(segment_label):
    if segment_label == 1:  # Example: 1 represents Bullish
        # Execute Buy Order
        pass
    elif segment_label == 0:  # Example: 0 represents Bearish
        # Execute Sell Order
        pass
    # Implement additional logic as needed

while True:
    live_data = fetch_live_data()
    if live_data:
        processed_sequence = preprocess_live_data(live_data)
        segment = get_segment_label(processed_sequence)
        trading_strategy(segment)
    time.sleep(60)  # Adjust based on data frequency
```

**Notes:**

- **Latency**: Ensure minimal latency in data processing and API responses.
- **Scalability**: Design the system to handle high-frequency data efficiently.
- **Reliability**: Implement error handling and fail-safes to maintain system stability.

## 10. Best Practices and Considerations

1. **Consistent Preprocessing**: Ensure that all preprocessing steps applied during training are identically applied during inference.
2. **Model Evaluation**: Continuously monitor model performance and retrain as necessary to adapt to market changes.
3. **Feature Importance**: Analyze which Matching Pursuit coefficients contribute most to segmentation accuracy.
4. **Scaling**: Utilize GPU acceleration for both training and inference to handle complex computations efficiently.
5. **Security**: Safeguard API keys and sensitive data, especially when deploying models in production environments.
6. **Backtesting**: Rigorously backtest your segmentation and trading strategies on historical data before live deployment.
7. **Documentation**: Maintain comprehensive documentation for your data pipelines, models, and APIs to facilitate maintenance and scalability.
