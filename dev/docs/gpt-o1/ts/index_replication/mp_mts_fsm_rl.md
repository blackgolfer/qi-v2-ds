## 1. Understanding the Enhanced Framework

### 1.1. Overview of the Combined Approach

The enhanced framework combines three core components to achieve efficient stock index replication with dynamic portfolio adjustments:

- **Matching Pursuit (MP)**: Selects a sparse subset of stocks that best approximate the target index's returns while adhering to inequality constraints.
- **Finite State Machines (FSMs)**: Monitor and manage portfolio states across multiple time scales, identifying distinct market regimes.
- **Reinforcement Learning (RL)**: Makes intelligent overweight and underweight decisions based on state information from FSMs and the sparse representation from MP.

This integration allows the system to not only approximate the index efficiently but also adaptively adjust the portfolio weights in response to changing market conditions.

### 1.2. Roles of Matching Pursuit, FSMs, and RL

- **Matching Pursuit (MP)**:
  - **Purpose**: Perform sparse approximation by selecting a minimal set of stocks that can closely replicate the index's performance.
  - **Output**: Selected stock identifiers and their initial weights.

- **Finite State Machines (FSMs)**:
  - **Purpose**: Analyze market conditions across different time scales and maintain current state information.
  - **Output**: Current market state(s) influencing portfolio adjustments.

- **Reinforcement Learning (RL)**:
  - **Purpose**: Decide on overweighting or underweighting specific stocks based on the current state from FSMs and the MP selection.
  - **Output**: Adjusted portfolio weights to better align with the target index under current market conditions.

---

## 2. Designing the Reinforcement Learning Component

### 2.1. Defining the RL Problem

To integrate RL into our portfolio management system, we need to frame it as a Reinforcement Learning problem. This involves defining the **agent**, **environment**, **state**, **action**, and **reward**.

- **Agent**: The RL entity responsible for making portfolio adjustments.
- **Environment**: The financial market data and the current state of the portfolio.
- **State**: Information about the current market conditions and portfolio performance.
- **Action**: Portfolio adjustments, specifically overweighting or underweighting selected stocks.
- **Reward**: Feedback signal guiding the agent towards desirable portfolio performance.

### 2.2. Formulating States, Actions, and Rewards

#### **State (`S`)**

The state should encapsulate all relevant information the RL agent needs to make informed decisions. In this context, the state can include:

1. **Market Indicators**:
   - Output from FSMs across multiple time scales.
   - Technical indicators (e.g., RSI, MACD).
   - Recent returns or volatility measures.

2. **Portfolio Information**:
   - Current weights of selected stocks.
   - Portfolio returns.
   - Risk metrics (e.g., Value at Risk, Sharpe Ratio).

3. **Residual Information**:
   - The residual from the Matching Pursuit approximation.

**Example State Representation**:

```plaintext
State = {
    short_term_state: "bullish",
    medium_term_state: "neutral",
    long_term_state: "bearish",
    current_weights: [0.05, 0.15, 0.10, ...],
    portfolio_return: 0.0025,
    portfolio_risk: 0.01
}
```

#### **Action (`A`)**

Actions represent the decisions the RL agent can make to adjust the portfolio. In this scenario:

- **Overweight**: Increase the weight of a selected stock.
- **Underweight**: Decrease the weight of a selected stock.
- **Hold**: Maintain the current weight.

To manage complexity, actions can be discrete or continuous:

- **Discrete Actions**:
  - Action space is a set of possible transitions (e.g., +10% weight on Stock A).

- **Continuous Actions**:
  - Action space allows for fine-grained weight adjustments (e.g., adjust weight of Stock A by delta).

**Example Action Space**:

```plaintext
Action = {
    over_weight: {stock_id: 0.05},
    under_weight: {stock_id: -0.05},
    hold: {}
}
```

#### **Reward (`R`)**

The reward function quantifies the desirability of the actions taken by the agent. It should align with the portfolio's performance objectives.

**Potential Reward Signals**:

1. **Return-Based Rewards**:
   - **Positive Reward**: Assign for achieving higher than target returns.
   - **Negative Reward**: Assign for underperforming returns.

2. **Risk-Based Rewards**:
   - Incorporate risk-adjusted returns (e.g., Sharpe Ratio).
   - Penalize excessive volatility.

3. **Tracking Error**:
   - Reward minimization of the tracking error between the portfolio and the target index.

4. **Transaction Costs**:
   - Penalize excessive trading to account for real-world costs.

**Example Reward Function**:

```python
def calculate_reward(portfolio_return, target_return, tracking_error, transaction_costs):
    # Reward based on excess return
    excess_return = portfolio_return - target_return
    reward = excess_return
    
    # Penalize for high tracking error
    reward -= tracking_error * 0.5
    
    # Penalize for high transaction costs
    reward -= transaction_costs * 0.2
    
    return reward
```

### 2.3. Choosing the Right RL Algorithm

Selecting an appropriate RL algorithm is crucial for effective learning. Some suitable algorithms include:

- **Deep Q-Network (DQN)**:
  - Suitable for discrete action spaces.
  - Utilizes Q-learning with deep neural networks.

- **Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)**:
  - Suitable for both discrete and continuous action spaces.
  - Balances exploration and exploitation effectively.

- **Advantage Actor-Critic (A2C/A3C)**:
  - Combines policy-based and value-based methods.
  - Suitable for complex environments.

**Recommendation**:

- **Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)** is highly recommended due to its robustness, stability, and suitability for continuous and high-dimensional action spaces, making it ideal for portfolio optimization tasks.

## 3. Integrating RL with Matching Pursuit and FSMs

### 3.1. Data Flow and Interaction

The integration workflow involves the following steps:

1. **Data Preparation**:
   - Collect and preprocess OHLC and other relevant data.
   - Apply Matching Pursuit to select a sparse subset of stocks.

2. **State Determination**:
   - Use FSMs operating at multiple time scales to analyze market conditions based on the selected stocks.
   - Formulate the current state incorporating FSM outputs and portfolio metrics.

3. **RL Decision Making**:
   - The RL agent takes the current state as input and outputs actions to adjust portfolio weights (overweight/underweight).

4. **Portfolio Adjustment**:
   - Modify the portfolio based on RL actions.
   - Calculate new portfolio metrics and update residuals.

5. **Reward Assignment**:
   - Evaluate the performance of the adjusted portfolio relative to the target index.
   - Assign rewards to guide the RL agent's learning process.

6. **Iterative Training**:
   - Repeat the process iteratively, allowing the RL agent to learn optimal adjustment strategies over time.

### 3.2. Decision-Making Process

Here's how the components interact:

1. **Matching Pursuit (MP)** selects a subset of stocks and assigns initial weights based on their correlation with the target index.

2. **Multi-Time-Scale FSMs** analyze the selected stocks' behavior over different time scales to identify the current market regime.

3. **RL Agent** receives the current state (market regime via FSMs and portfolio metrics) and decides on actions to adjust the weights of the selected stocks (overweight or underweight).

4. **Portfolio Update**: The portfolio is adjusted according to the RL agent's actions, and the updated performance is measured to compute rewards.

5. **Feedback Loop**: The reward is fed back to the RL agent to refine its policy for future decisions.

## 4. Implementing the Combined System in Python

### 4.1. Setting Up the Development Environment

Ensure you have Python 3.7+ installed. Create a virtual environment and install necessary libraries.

```bash
# Create a virtual environment
python3 -m venv fsm_rl_env
source fsm_rl_env/bin/activate

# Upgrade pip
pip install --upgrade pip

# Install required libraries
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn torch transformers ta ccxt xstate gym stable-baselines3
```

**Libraries Overview**:

- **pandas & numpy**: Data manipulation.
- **scikit-learn**: Data preprocessing and ML utilities.
- **matplotlib & seaborn**: Data visualization.
- **torch**: PyTorch for deep learning.
- **transformers**: Hugging Face's library for Transformer models.
- **ta**: Technical analysis indicators.
- **ccxt**: Cryptocurrency data fetching.
- **xstate**: State machine implementation.
- **gym**: RL environments.
- **stable-baselines3**: RL algorithms.

### 4.2. Implementing Matching Pursuit with Constraints

We'll use **Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP)** from `scikit-learn` to select a sparse subset of stocks.

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from sklearn.linear_model import OrthogonalMatchingPursuit

def apply_matching_pursuit(index_returns, constituent_returns, max_features=10, tol=0.1):
    """
    Apply Orthogonal Matching Pursuit to select stocks that approximate the index.
    
    Parameters:
    - index_returns: pd.Series of target index returns.
    - constituent_returns: pd.DataFrame of constituent stocks' returns.
    - max_features: Maximum number of stocks to select.
    - tol: Tolerance for the residual norm.
    
    Returns:
    - selected_stocks: List of selected stock tickers.
    - weights: Corresponding weights for the selected stocks.
    """
    # Align the data
    data = constituent_returns.loc[index_returns.index]
    
    # Normalize the data
    data_mean = data.mean()
    data_std = data.std()
    X = (data - data_mean) / data_std
    y = (index_returns - index_returns.mean()) / index_returns.std()
    
    # Initialize OMP
    omp = OrthogonalMatchingPursuit(n_nonzero_coefs=max_features, tol=tol)
    omp.fit(X, y)
    
    # Get selected features
    selected_indices = np.where(omp.coef_ != 0)[0]
    selected_stocks = [constituent_returns.columns[i] for i in selected_indices]
    selected_weights = omp.coef_[selected_indices]
    
    # Adjust weights back to original scale
    selected_weights = selected_weights / X.iloc[:, selected_indices].var().values
    selected_weights = selected_weights * index_returns.std() / constituent_returns[selected_stocks].std().values
    
    # Normalize weights to sum to 1
    weights = selected_weights / np.sum(np.abs(selected_weights))
    
    return selected_stocks, weights
```

**Explanation**:

- **Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP)**: Selects a limited number of features (stocks) that best approximate the target signal (index returns).
- **Normalization**: Ensures that both target and features are on the same scale for accurate correlation measurement.
- **Weight Adjustment**: Transforms the OMP coefficients back to the original return scale.
- **Normalization of Weights**: Ensures the portfolio weights sum to 1.

### 4.3. Designing and Implementing Multi-Time-Scale FSMs

We'll use the **`transitions`** library (similar to `xstate` but more Pythonic) for FSM implementation. If `xstate` is required in Python, consider using `transitions` or similar Python libraries.

```bash
pip install transitions
```

**FSM Implementation Example**:

```python
from transitions import Machine

class MarketFSM:
    states = ['bullish', 'bearish', 'neutral']

    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
        self.machine = Machine(model=self, states=MarketFSM.states, initial='neutral')

        # Define transitions
        self.machine.add_transition(trigger='to_bullish', source=['bearish', 'neutral'], dest='bullish')
        self.machine.add_transition(trigger='to_bearish', source=['bullish', 'neutral'], dest='bearish')
        self.machine.add_transition(trigger='to_neutral', source=['bullish', 'bearish'], dest='neutral')

    def on_enter_bullish(self):
        print(f"{self.name} State: Bullish")

    def on_enter_bearish(self):
        print(f"{self.name} State: Bearish")

    def on_enter_neutral(self):
        print(f"{self.name} State: Neutral")
```

**Multi-Time-Scale FSMs**:

Create separate FSM instances for different time scales (short, medium, long).

```python
# Initialize FSMs
short_term_fsm = MarketFSM('Short-Term')
medium_term_fsm = MarketFSM('Medium-Term')
long_term_fsm = MarketFSM('Long-Term')
```

**Updating FSMs Based on Indicators**:

Define criteria based on technical indicators to transition states.

```python
def update_fsm(fsm, indicator_value, thresholds):
    """
    Update FSM state based on indicator value and predefined thresholds.
    
    Parameters:
    - fsm: Instance of MarketFSM.
    - indicator_value: Current value of the technical indicator.
    - thresholds: Dict with 'bullish_threshold' and 'bearish_threshold'.
    """
    if indicator_value > thresholds['bullish_threshold']:
        fsm.to_bullish()
    elif indicator_value < thresholds['bearish_threshold']:
        fsm.to_bearish()
    else:
        fsm.to_neutral()
```

**Example Usage**:

```python
# Example technical indicator thresholds
short_term_thresholds = {'bullish_threshold': 70, 'bearish_threshold': 30}
medium_term_thresholds = {'bullish_threshold': 60, 'bearish_threshold': 40}
long_term_thresholds = {'bullish_threshold': 65, 'bearish_threshold': 35}

# Update FSMs based on RSI
def update_market_states(df):
    # Assume 'rsi' column exists
    latest_rsi = df['rsi'].iloc[-1]
    
    # Short-Term FSM
    short_rsi = df['rsi_short'].iloc[-1]
    update_fsm(short_term_fsm, short_rsi, short_term_thresholds)
    
    # Medium-Term FSM
    medium_rsi = df['rsi_medium'].iloc[-1]
    update_fsm(medium_term_fsm, medium_rsi, medium_term_thresholds)
    
    # Long-Term FSM
    long_rsi = df['rsi_long'].iloc[-1]
    update_fsm(long_term_fsm, long_rsi, long_term_thresholds)
```

**Note**: The above is a simplified example. In practice, the state transitions should be based on comprehensive technical indicators and possibly combined signals from multiple indicators.

### 4.4. Designing the RL Agent

We'll use **Stable Baselines3**, a popular RL library in Python, which provides implementations of various RL algorithms.

**Installing Stable Baselines3**:

```bash
pip install stable-baselines3
```

**Defining the RL Environment**:

To integrate RL with our system, define a custom environment adhering to the OpenAI Gym interface. This environment will encapsulate the state, actions, rewards, and step logic.

```python
import gym
from gym import spaces

class PortfolioEnv(gym.Env):
    """
    Custom Environment for Portfolio Management with RL.
    """
    def __init__(self, 
                 selected_stocks, 
                 index_returns, 
                 constituent_returns, 
                 initial_weights, 
                 fsm_states, 
                 transaction_cost=0.001):
        super(PortfolioEnv, self).__init__()
        
        self.stocks = selected_stocks
        self.index_returns = index_returns
        self.constituent_returns = constituent_returns[self.stocks]
        self.n_stocks = len(self.stocks)
        self.transaction_cost = transaction_cost
        
        # Action space: continuous values between -0.1 and 0.1 for each stock
        # representing weight adjustments (underweight, hold, overweight)
        self.action_space = spaces.Box(low=-0.1, high=0.1, shape=(self.n_stocks,), dtype=np.float32)
        
        # Observation space: combination of FSM states and portfolio metrics
        # For simplicity, encode FSM states as integers
        self.observation_space = spaces.Box(low=-np.inf, high=np.inf, shape=(self.n_stocks + 4,), dtype=np.float32)
        
        # Initialize variables
        self.current_step = 0
        self.max_steps = len(index_returns) - 1
        self.weights = np.array(initial_weights)
        self.fsm_states = fsm_states  # Dict with multi-time-scale FSM states
        
    def reset(self):
        self.current_step = 0
        self.weights = np.array([1.0 / self.n_stocks] * self.n_stocks)
        return self._get_obs()
    
    def _get_obs(self):
        # Encode FSM states numerically
        # Example encoding: bullish=1, neutral=0, bearish=-1
        state_encoding = []
        for fsm in self.fsm_states.values():
            if fsm.state == 'bullish':
                state_encoding.append(1)
            elif fsm.state == 'bearish':
                state_encoding.append(-1)
            else:
                state_encoding.append(0)
        
        # Portfolio metrics: current weights and cumulative returns
        portfolio_return = np.dot(self.constituent_returns.iloc[self.current_step], self.weights)
        portfolio_cumulative_return = np.sum(self.index_returns.iloc[:self.current_step+1] * portfolio_return)
        portfolio_risk = np.std(self.constituent_returns.iloc[:self.current_step+1] * self.weights)
        
        obs = np.concatenate((self.weights, state_encoding, [portfolio_return, portfolio_cumulative_return, portfolio_risk]))
        return obs.astype(np.float32)
    
    def step(self, action):
        done = False
        info = {}
        
        # Clip action to action space
        action = np.clip(action, self.action_space.low, self.action_space.high)
        
        # Apply action: adjust weights
        new_weights = self.weights + action
        new_weights = np.clip(new_weights, 0, 1)  # Ensure weights are non-negative
        
        # Normalize weights to sum to 1
        if new_weights.sum() == 0:
            new_weights = self.weights  # Prevent division by zero
        else:
            new_weights = new_weights / new_weights.sum()
        
        # Calculate portfolio return
        current_return = np.dot(self.constituent_returns.iloc[self.current_step], new_weights)
        target_return = self.index_returns.iloc[self.current_step]
        tracking_error = np.abs(current_return - target_return)
        
        # Calculate transaction costs
        transaction_costs = np.sum(np.abs(new_weights - self.weights)) * self.transaction_cost
        
        # Calculate reward
        reward = current_return - tracking_error * 0.5 - transaction_costs
        
        # Update weights
        self.weights = new_weights
        
        # Advance to next step
        self.current_step += 1
        
        if self.current_step >= self.max_steps:
            done = True
        
        # Update FSM states based on new data
        # This requires integrating FSM update logic here or externally
        
        obs = self._get_obs()
        return obs, reward, done, info
    
    def render(self, mode='human'):
        pass  # Implement visualization if needed
```

**Explanation**:

- **Action Space**: Represents adjustments to portfolio weights. Values range between -0.1 and 0.1, allowing for underweighting or overweighting.
  
- **Observation Space**: Combines portfolio weights, FSM states, and portfolio metrics (e.g., return, risk).

- **Reward Function**: Balances return maximization with tracking error minimization and transaction cost penalties.

### 4.5. Integrating All Components

1. **Data Preparation**:
   - Apply Matching Pursuit to select stocks and determine initial weights.
   - Preprocess and align data.

2. **FSM Updates**:
   - Update FSM states based on technical indicators or other signals.

3. **RL Environment Setup**:
   - Initialize the `PortfolioEnv` with selected stocks, initial weights, and FSM states.

4. **RL Agent Training**:
   - Train the RL agent using the defined environment to learn optimal weight adjustments.

5. **Portfolio Adjustment**:
   - Use the RL agent's learned policy to make dynamic portfolio adjustments based on FSM states.

### 4.6. Example Code

Here's an end-to-end example integrating MP, FSMs, and RL using **Stable Baselines3** with the **PPO** algorithm.

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from sklearn.linear_model import OrthogonalMatchingPursuit
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from transitions import Machine
import gym
from gym import spaces
from stable_baselines3 import PPO
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Step 1: Data Collection and Preparation
# (Assuming `index_data` and `constituent_data` are already fetched as per previous steps)

# Step 2: Data Preprocessing
def calculate_returns(df):
    return df.pct_change().dropna()

index_returns = calculate_returns(index_data['Close'])
constituent_returns = calculate_returns(combined_constituent_data)

# Calculate technical indicators (e.g., RSI)
import ta

def add_technical_indicators(df):
    df['rsi'] = ta.momentum.RSIIndicator(close=df['Close'], window=14).rsi()
    df['sma_50'] = ta.trend.SMAIndicator(close=df['Close'], window=50).sma_indicator()
    df['sma_200'] = ta.trend.SMAIndicator(close=df['Close'], window=200).sma_indicator()
    df = df.dropna()
    return df

for ticker in constituent_returns.columns:
    constituent_returns[ticker] = add_technical_indicators(constituent_returns[[ticker]]).iloc[:,0]

index_returns = add_technical_indicators(index_returns.to_frame()).iloc[:,0]

# Step 3: Feature Engineering
def apply_matching_pursuit(index_returns, constituent_returns, max_features=10, tol=0.1):
    data = constituent_returns.loc[index_returns.index]
    scaler = StandardScaler()
    X = scaler.fit_transform(data)
    y = scaler.transform(index_returns.values.reshape(-1, 1)).flatten()
    
    omp = OrthogonalMatchingPursuit(n_nonzero_coefs=max_features, tol=tol)
    omp.fit(X, y)
    
    selected_indices = np.where(omp.coef_ != 0)[0]
    selected_stocks = [constituent_returns.columns[i] for i in selected_indices]
    selected_weights = omp.coef_[selected_indices]
    
    # Adjust weights back to original scale
    selected_weights = selected_weights / np.square(X[:, selected_indices]).sum(axis=0)
    selected_weights = selected_weights * y.std() / constituent_returns[selected_stocks].std().values
    
    # Normalize weights to sum to 1
    weights = selected_weights / np.sum(np.abs(selected_weights))
    
    return selected_stocks, weights

selected_stocks, initial_weights = apply_matching_pursuit(index_returns, constituent_returns)

print("Selected Stocks and Weights:")

### 4.6. Example Code

Here's an example of integrating MP, FSMs, and RL using **Stable Baselines3** with the **PPO** algorithm.

```python
# Continue from previous steps

# Step 3: Process entire data and select stocks
selected_stocks, initial_weights = apply_matching_pursuit(index_returns, constituent_returns)

# Initialize FSMs
short_term_fsm = MarketFSM('Short-Term')
medium_term_fsm = MarketFSM('Medium-Term')
long_term_fsm = MarketFSM('Long-Term')

fsm_states = {
    'short_term': short_term_fsm,
    'medium_term': medium_term_fsm,
    'long_term': long_term_fsm
}

# Initialize Gym environment
env = PortfolioEnv(
    selected_stocks=selected_stocks,
    index_returns=index_returns,
    constituent_returns=constituent_returns,
    initial_weights=initial_weights,
    fsm_states=fsm_states,
    transaction_cost=0.001
)

# Initialize RL Agent
model = PPO('MlpPolicy', env, verbose=1)
model.learn(total_timesteps=10000)

# Save the model
model.save("ppo_portfolio_model")

# To load the model later
# model = PPO.load("ppo_portfolio_model", env=env)

# Test the trained agent
obs = env.reset()
rewards = []
for _ in range(env.max_steps):
    action, _states = model.predict(obs, deterministic=True)
    obs, reward, done, info = env.step(action)
    rewards.append(reward)
    if done:
        break

# Plot cumulative rewards
cumulative_rewards = np.cumsum(rewards)
plt.plot(cumulative_rewards)
plt.title('Cumulative Rewards Over Time')
plt.xlabel('Steps')
plt.ylabel('Cumulative Reward')
plt.show()
```

**Explanation**:

1. **MP Application**: Selects the top 10 stocks that best approximate the S&P 500 index.

2. **FSM Initialization**: Sets up FSMs for short-term, medium-term, and long-term time scales.

3. **Environment Setup**: `PortfolioEnv` encapsulates the portfolio management logic, integrating MP and FSM outputs.

4. **RL Agent Training**: Uses PPO from Stable Baselines3 to train the agent over 10,000 timesteps.

5. **Model Saving and Loading**: Enables persistent agent training and usage.

6. **Testing and Visualization**: Runs the trained agent through the environment and plots cumulative rewards to assess performance.

**Note**: This is a simplified example. In practice, you would likely require more sophisticated state representations, richer feature sets, and extensive hyperparameter tuning to achieve optimal performance.

## 5. Backtesting and Evaluation

### 5.1. Defining Evaluation Metrics

To assess the effectiveness of the combined MP, FSM, and RL approach, utilize the following metrics:

- **Cumulative Returns**: Overall profit or loss over the backtest period.
  
- **Annualized Return**: Standardized return metric over a year.
  
- **Annualized Volatility**: Measure of the strategy's risk.
  
- **Sharpe Ratio**: Risk-adjusted return.
  
- **Tracking Error**: Measures how closely the portfolio tracks the target index.
  
- **Maximum Drawdown**: The largest peak-to-trough decline.
  
- **Sortino Ratio**: Focuses on downside volatility.

### 5.2. Conducting Backtests

Implement backtesting to simulate the strategy's performance on historical data.

```python
# Assuming the environment and model are already defined and trained

def backtest(env, model):
    obs = env.reset()
    rewards = []
    portfolio_values = [np.sum(env.weights)]
    
    for _ in range(env.max_steps):
        action, _states = model.predict(obs, deterministic=True)
        obs, reward, done, info = env.step(action)
        rewards.append(reward)
        portfolio_values.append(np.sum(env.weights))
        if done:
            break
    
    # Calculate cumulative returns
    cumulative_returns = np.cumsum(rewards)
    
    return cumulative_returns, portfolio_values

cumulative_returns, portfolio_values = backtest(env, model)

# Plot cumulative returns
plt.figure(figsize=(12,6))
plt.plot(cumulative_returns, label='Cumulative Returns')
plt.title('Cumulative Returns Over Time')
plt.xlabel('Steps')
plt.ylabel('Cumulative Returns')
plt.legend()
plt.show()

# Plot portfolio values
plt.figure(figsize=(12,6))
plt.plot(portfolio_values, label='Portfolio Value')
plt.title('Portfolio Value Over Time')
plt.xlabel('Steps')
plt.ylabel('Value')
plt.legend()
plt.show()
```

### 5.3. Analyzing Results

Evaluate the strategy's performance based on the defined metrics:

- **Compare Cumulative and Annualized Returns** against the target index to assess replication accuracy.
  
- **Assess Sharpe and Sortino Ratios** to understand risk-adjusted performance.
  
- **Examine Tracking Error** to evaluate how closely the portfolio follows the index.
  
- **Review Maximum Drawdown** to understand potential losses during adverse market conditions.
