## 1. Introduction

Replicating a stock index involves creating a portfolio that mirrors the index's performance. **Exact replication** requires holding all constituent stocks in their exact proportions, which can be impractical due to high transaction costs and management complexity, especially for indices with numerous members. **Approximation with inequality constraints** offers a viable alternative by selecting a representative subset of stocks and determining their weights to closely match the index's performance within predefined constraints.

**Matching Pursuit (MP)** is a powerful algorithm for sparse approximation, adept at selecting a minimal set of atoms (in this case, stocks) from a dictionary (the full set of constituents) to represent a target signal (the index). By integrating **inequality constraints**, we can ensure that the resulting portfolio adheres to practical investment guidelines, such as weight limits or sector diversification.

This guide provides a comprehensive, step-by-step approach to replicating a stock index using Matching Pursuit with inequality constraints, implemented in Python.

---

## 2. Understanding the Concepts

### 2.1. Stock Index Replication vs. Approximation

- **Exact Replication**:
  - **Definition**: Holding all constituent stocks in the exact proportions as the target index.
  - **Pros**:
    - High fidelity to the index.
    - Simplest form of tracking.
  - **Cons**:
    - High transaction costs.
    - Management complexity with large indices.
    - Limited flexibility in portfolio adjustments.

- **Approximation with Inequality Constraints**:
  - **Definition**: Selecting a subset of constituent stocks and assigning weights that approximate the index's performance while adhering to specific constraints.
  - **Pros**:
    - Reduced transaction costs.
    - Enhanced manageability.
    - Flexibility to incorporate investment guidelines.
  - **Cons**:
    - Potential deviation from the index.
    - Requires sophisticated optimization techniques.

### 2.2. Matching Pursuit Algorithm

**Matching Pursuit (MP)** is a greedy algorithm used for sparse approximation by iteratively selecting the best-matching atom from a dictionary to represent a target signal.

- **Steps**:
  1. **Initialize**: Set the residual as the target signal.
  2. **Iterative Selection**:
     - Select the atom most correlated with the residual.
     - Update the residual by subtracting the projection of the residual onto the selected atom.
  3. **Termination**: Continue until the residual's norm falls below a threshold or a maximum number of atoms is selected.

- **In Stock Index Replication**:
  - **Target Signal**: Index's return series.
  - **Dictionary**: Set of constituent stocks' return series.
  - **Atoms**: Individual stock's return series.
  - **Sparse Representation**: Selecting a minimal set of stocks whose weighted returns approximate the index.

### 2.3. Inequality Constraints in Portfolio Construction

Inequality constraints ensure that the portfolio adheres to practical investment guidelines. Common constraints include:

- **Weight Limits**: Setting maximum and/or minimum weights for individual stocks.
  - Example: No single stock should exceed 5% of the portfolio.
  
- **Sector Diversification**: Limiting the portfolio's exposure to specific sectors.
  - Example: No more than 20% of the portfolio in the technology sector.
  
- **Risk Measures**: Ensuring the portfolio's risk profile aligns with investment objectives.
  - Example: Portfolio volatility should not exceed a certain threshold.
  
- **Liquidity Constraints**: Limiting investments to highly liquid stocks to facilitate easy trading.

Integrating these constraints into the MP algorithm ensures that the resulting portfolio is not only an accurate approximation of the index but also adheres to investment guidelines.

---

## 3. Step 1: Data Collection and Preparation

### 3.1. Selecting the Target Index

Choose a stock index you wish to replicate. Common choices include:

- **S&P 500**
- **NASDAQ-100**
- **Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA)**
- **Russell 2000**

**For this guide, we'll use the S&P 500 as the target index.**

### 3.2. Choosing Constituents

Obtain the list of constituent stocks of the chosen index. Sources include:

- **Official Index Websites**: [S&P Dow Jones Indices](https://www.spglobal.com/spdji/en/indices/equity/sp-500/#overview) for S&P 500.
- **Financial Data Providers**: Bloomberg, Reuters, Yahoo Finance.
- **APIs and Libraries**:
  - **`yfinance`**: Python library to fetch financial data from Yahoo Finance.

**Example: Fetching Constituents Using `yfinance`**

```python
import yfinance as yf
import pandas as pd

# Fetch the list of S&P 500 companies from Wikipedia
sp500 = pd.read_html('https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_S%26P_500_companies')[0]

# Display the first few rows
print(sp500.head())

# Extract ticker symbols
constituents = sp500['Symbol'].tolist()
```

*Note*: Ensure that ticker symbols are compatible with your data source (e.g., some exchanges use different suffixes).

### 3.3. Gathering Historical Data

Collect historical OHLC (Open, High, Low, Close) data for both the target index and its constituent stocks.

**Using `yfinance` to Fetch OHLC Data**

```python
import yfinance as yf
import pandas as pd
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

# Define the time period
end_date = datetime.today()
start_date = end_date - timedelta(days=365)  # Last 1 year

# Function to fetch data for a given ticker
def fetch_data(ticker, start, end):
    data = yf.download(ticker, start=start, end=end)
    data = data[['Open', 'High', 'Low', 'Close', 'Volume']]
    data = data.dropna()
    return data

# Fetch S&P 500 index data (Ticker: ^GSPC)
index_data = fetch_data('^GSPC', start_date, end_date)
print(index_data.head())

# Fetch data for constituents
# For demonstration, we'll fetch data for a subset (e.g., first 10)
sample_constituents = constituents[:10]

constituent_data = {}
for ticker in sample_constituents:
    print(f"Fetching data for {ticker}...")
    data = fetch_data(ticker, start_date, end_date)
    data.rename(columns={
        'Open': f'Open_{ticker}',
        'High': f'High_{ticker}',
        'Low': f'Low_{ticker}',
        'Close': f'Close_{ticker}',
        'Volume': f'Volume_{ticker}'
    }, inplace=True)
    constituent_data[ticker] = data

# Combine all constituent data into a single DataFrame
combined_constituent_data = pd.concat(constituent_data.values(), axis=1)
print(combined_constituent_data.head())
```

*Notes*:

- **Data Frequency**: Decide on the granularity (e.g., daily, weekly) based on your analysis needs.
- **Data Alignment**: Ensure all data series are aligned temporally; handle missing dates or non-trading days appropriately.

---

## 4. Step 2: Data Preprocessing

### 4.1. Handling Missing Data

Missing data can arise due to various reasons like non-trading days, stock suspensions, or data fetch errors. Handling missing values is crucial to maintain data integrity.

**Strategies**:

- **Forward Fill (`ffill`)**: Replace missing values with the last available data point.
- **Backward Fill (`bfill`)**: Use the next available data point to fill gaps.
- **Interpolation**: Estimate missing values based on surrounding data.

**Example: Forward Fill and Backward Fill**

```python
# Forward fill missing values
combined_constituent_data.ffill(inplace=True)

# Backward fill remaining missing values
combined_constituent_data.bfill(inplace=True)

# Verify no missing values remain
print(combined_constituent_data.isnull().sum())
```

### 4.2. Normalizing the Data

Normalization ensures that all features contribute equally to the model's learning process.

**Common Techniques**:

- **Min-Max Scaling**: Scales data to a fixed range, usually [0, 1].
- **Z-Score Standardization**: Centers data around the mean with a unit standard deviation.

**Example: Min-Max Scaling**

```python
from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler

# Initialize scaler
scaler = MinMaxScaler()

# Select features to scale
features_to_scale = [col for col in combined_constituent_data.columns if 'Close' in col]

# Fit and transform the data
combined_constituent_data[features_to_scale] = scaler.fit_transform(combined_constituent_data[features_to_scale])

print(combined_constituent_data.head())
```

### 4.3. Calculating Returns

Instead of using price levels, analyzing **returns** provides a normalized view of performance, facilitating better comparison and modeling.

**Types of Returns**:

- **Simple Returns**: \( R_t = \frac{P_t - P_{t-1}}{P_{t-1}} \)
- **Log Returns**: \( R_t = \ln\left(\frac{P_t}{P_{t-1}}\right) \)

**Example: Calculating Log Returns**

```python
import numpy as np

# Function to calculate log returns
def calculate_log_returns(df):
    return np.log(df / df.shift(1)).dropna()

# Calculate log returns for index
index_returns = calculate_log_returns(index_data['Close'])

# Calculate log returns for constituents
constituent_returns = calculate_log_returns(combined_constituent_data[[col for col in combined_constituent_data.columns if 'Close' in col]])

print(index_returns.head())
print(constituent_returns.head())
```

*Notes*:

- **Alignment**: Ensure that the return series for the index and constituents are aligned in time.
- **Handling NaNs**: The first value after shift operation will be NaN; hence, drop it.

---

## 5. Step 3: Feature Engineering

### 5.1. Creating the Design Matrix

The **design matrix** (or feature matrix) contains the independent variables used to approximate the target index's returns.

**Components**:

- **Intercept**: Optional, allows the model to account for mean shifts.
- **Stock Returns**: Independent variables representing constituent stock returns.

**Example: Constructing the Design Matrix**

```python
# Align the date indices
aligned_index_returns = index_returns.loc[constituent_returns.index]

# Create design matrix X and target vector y
X = constituent_returns.values  # Independent variables
y = aligned_index_returns.values.reshape(-1, 1)  # Dependent variable

print(X.shape, y.shape)  # (num_samples, num_features) (num_samples, 1)
```

### 5.2. Target Vector Preparation

The **target vector** `y` represents the S&P 500's (or chosen index's) returns that we aim to approximate.

*Handled in the previous step.*

---

## 6. Step 4: Implementing Matching Pursuit with Inequality Constraints

Matching Pursuit is inherently an approximation method, selecting a subset of atoms (stocks) to best represent the target signal (index returns). Integrating **inequality constraints** ensures that the resulting portfolio adheres to investment guidelines, such as limiting individual stock weights or maintaining sector diversification.

### 6.1. Formulating the Optimization Problem

**Objective**: Approximate the target index's returns using a sparse combination of constituent stock returns, adhering to inequality constraints.

**Mathematical Representation**:

$
\min_{\alpha} \| y - X\alpha \|_2^2
$

**Subject to**:

$$
\begin{cases}
\sum_{i} \alpha_i = 1 & \text{(Weights sum to 1)} \\
0 \leq \alpha_i \leq w_{\text{max}} & \forall i \in \{1, \dots, n\} \\
\sum_{i \in S} \alpha_i \leq s_{\text{max}} & \text{(Sector constraints)}
\end{cases}
$$

- $y$: Target index's return vector.
- $X$: Design matrix of constituent stock returns.
- $\alpha$: Vector of stock weights in the portfolio.
- $w_{\text{max}}$: Maximum allowable weight for any single stock.
- $S$: Subset of stocks within a specific sector.
- $s_{\text{max}}$: Maximum allowable combined weight for a sector.

### 6.2. Adapting Matching Pursuit for Constraints

**Standard Matching Pursuit (MP)** does not inherently support constraints. To integrate inequality constraints, we'll adopt a **two-step approach**:

1. **Selection Phase**: Use MP to select a subset of stocks that best approximate the index.
2. **Weighting Phase**: Assign weights to the selected stocks by solving a constrained optimization problem.

This approach leverages MP's ability to identify relevant features (stocks) and then uses optimization techniques to ensure the portfolio adheres to investment constraints.

### 6.3. Implementation Using Python

**Libraries Needed**:

- **`numpy`** and **`pandas`**: For data manipulation.
- **`scikit-learn`**: For MP implementation.
- **`scipy.optimize`**: For constrained optimization.

**Step-by-Step Implementation**:

#### **Step 6.3.1: Implementing Matching Pursuit for Stock Selection**

We can use `OrthogonalMatchingPursuit` from `scikit-learn` to select relevant stocks.

```python
from sklearn.linear_model import OrthogonalMatchingPursuit
import numpy as np

# Initialize Orthogonal Matching Pursuit
omp = OrthogonalMatchingPursuit(n_nonzero_coefs=10)  # Limit to top 10 stocks

# Fit the model
omp.fit(X, y.ravel())

# Get selected stock indices
selected_indices = omp.support_

# Get the selected stock returns
selected_stock_returns = X[:, selected_indices]

# Get selected stock tickers
selected_tickers = [constituents[i] for i, selected in enumerate(selected_indices) if selected]
print("Selected Stocks:", selected_tickers)
```

**Notes**:

- **`n_nonzero_coefs`**: Specifies the maximum number of stocks to select. Adjust based on desired portfolio size.
- **Greedy Selection**: MP selects stocks that most reduce the residual error at each step.

#### **Step 6.3.2: Assigning Weights with Inequality Constraints**

After selecting the stocks, assign weights by solving the following optimization:

$$
\min_{\alpha} \| y - X_{\text{selected}} \alpha \|_2^2
$$

**Subject to**:

$$
\begin{cases}
\sum_{i} \alpha_i = 1 \\
0 \leq \alpha_i \leq w_{\text{max}} \quad \forall i
\end{cases}
$$

**Implementation Using `scipy.optimize`**

```python
from scipy.optimize import minimize

# Define the objective function (mean squared error)
def objective(weights, X, y):
    return np.mean((y - X @ weights) ** 2)

# Constraints: Weights sum to 1
def constraint_sum(weights):
    return np.sum(weights) - 1

# Bounds: 0 <= weights <= w_max
w_max = 0.05  # Example: no more than 5% in any single stock
bounds = [(0, w_max) for _ in range(len(selected_tickers))]

# Initial guess: equal weights
initial_weights = np.array([1/len(selected_tickers) for _ in range(len(selected_tickers))])

# Set up constraints and bounds
constraints = ({'type': 'eq', 'fun': constraint_sum})

# Perform optimization
result = minimize(objective, initial_weights, args=(selected_stock_returns, y.ravel()),
                  method='SLSQP', bounds=bounds, constraints=constraints)

if result.success:
    optimized_weights = result.x
    print("Optimized Weights:", optimized_weights)
else:
    raise ValueError("Optimization failed:", result.message)
```

**Notes**:

- **Objective Function**: Minimizes the mean squared error between the index returns and the portfolio's returns.
- **Constraints**:
  - **Sum to 1**: Ensures the portfolio is fully invested.
  - **Weight Limits**: Prevents overexposure to any single stock.
- **Optimization Method**: Sequential Least Squares Programming (`SLSQP`) is suitable for constrained optimization.
  
#### **Step 6.3.3: Combining Selection and Weighting Phases**

Encapsulate the process into functions for modularity.

```python
def select_stocks_mp(X, y, n_coefs):
    omp = OrthogonalMatchingPursuit(n_nonzero_coefs=n_coefs)
    omp.fit(X, y.ravel())
    selected_indices = omp.support_
    selected_stock_returns = X[:, selected_indices]
    selected_tickers = [constituents[i] for i, selected in enumerate(selected_indices) if selected]
    return selected_tickers, selected_stock_returns

def assign_weights(X_selected, y, w_max):
    def objective(weights):
        return np.mean((y - X_selected @ weights) ** 2)
    
    def constraint_sum(weights):
        return np.sum(weights) - 1
    
    bounds = [(0, w_max) for _ in range(X_selected.shape[1])]
    initial_weights = np.array([1/X_selected.shape[1]] * X_selected.shape[1])
    constraints = {'type': 'eq', 'fun': constraint_sum}
    
    result = minimize(objective, initial_weights, method='SLSQP',
                      bounds=bounds, constraints=constraints)
    
    if result.success:
        return result.x
    else:
        raise ValueError("Optimization failed:", result.message)

# Example Usage
selected_tickers, selected_stock_returns = select_stocks_mp(X, y, n_coefs=10)
optimized_weights = assign_weights(selected_stock_returns, y, w_max=0.05)

print("Selected Stocks and Weights:")
for ticker, weight in zip(selected_tickers, optimized_weights):
    print(f"{ticker}: {weight:.2%}")
```

*Output Example*:

```
Selected Stocks and Weights:
AAPL: 4.50%
MSFT: 4.50%
AMZN: 4.50%
GOOGL: 4.00%
FB: 4.00%
TSLA: 4.00%
NVDA: 3.30%
JPM: 4.00%
V: 3.00%
UNH: 3.20%
```

*Notes*:

- **Adjust `n_coefs`**: Determines the number of stocks in the portfolio. Trade-off between replication accuracy and portfolio sparsity.
- **Adjust `w_max`**: Ensures portfolio diversification and adherence to investment guidelines.

---

## 7. Step 5: Portfolio Construction

### 7.1. Calculating Weights with Constraints

*Already covered in Step 6.3.2 and encapsulated in the `assign_weights` function.*

### 7.2. Forming the Replicating Portfolio

Combine the selected stocks and their optimized weights to form the replicating portfolio.

```python
# Create a DataFrame for the portfolio
portfolio = pd.DataFrame({
    'Ticker': selected_tickers,
    'Weight': optimized_weights
})

print(portfolio)
```

*Sample Output*:

| Ticker | Weight |
|--------|--------|
| AAPL   | 0.045  |
| MSFT   | 0.045  |
| AMZN   | 0.045  |
| GOOGL  | 0.040  |
| FB     | 0.040  |
| TSLA   | 0.040  |
| NVDA   | 0.033  |
| JPM    | 0.040  |
| V      | 0.030  |
| UNH    | 0.032  |

*Notes*:

- **Interpretation**: Each entry indicates the proportion of the portfolio allocated to each stock.
- **Investment Guidelines**: Ensure that weights comply with your specific investment constraints beyond `w_max` if necessary.

---

## 8. Step 6: Backtesting and Evaluation

### 8.1. Defining Evaluation Metrics

To assess the effectiveness of the replicating portfolio, employ various performance metrics:

- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: Measures the average squared difference between the index returns and portfolio returns.
  
  \[
  \text{MSE} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{t=1}^{n} (R_{\text{index}}(t) - R_{\text{portfolio}}(t))^2
  \]
  
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: Average absolute difference between index returns and portfolio returns.
  
  \[
  \text{MAE} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{t=1}^{n} |R_{\text{index}}(t) - R_{\text{portfolio}}(t)|
  \]
  
- **Correlation Coefficient**: Measures the linear relationship between index returns and portfolio returns.
  
- **Tracking Error**: The standard deviation of the difference between the portfolio returns and the index returns.
  
- **R-squared (\( R^2 \))**: Indicates the proportion of variance in the index returns explained by the portfolio returns.

### 8.2. Comparing Replicating Portfolio vs. Target Index

**Compute Portfolio Returns**

```python
# Calculate portfolio returns
portfolio_returns = (optimized_weights * selected_stock_returns).sum(axis=1)

# Align the index returns
aligned_index_returns = index_returns.loc[portfolio_returns.index]

# Compute Evaluation Metrics

from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error, mean_absolute_error
import numpy as np

# MSE and MAE
mse = mean_squared_error(aligned_index_returns, portfolio_returns)
mae = mean_absolute_error(aligned_index_returns, portfolio_returns)

# Correlation Coefficient
correlation = np.corrcoef(aligned_index_returns, portfolio_returns)[0, 1]

# Tracking Error
tracking_error = np.std(aligned_index_returns - portfolio_returns)

# R-squared
from sklearn.metrics import r2_score
r_squared = r2_score(aligned_index_returns, portfolio_returns)

print(f"Mean Squared Error (MSE): {mse:.6f}")
print(f"Mean Absolute Error (MAE): {mae:.6f}")
print(f"Correlation Coefficient: {correlation:.4f}")
print(f"Tracking Error: {tracking_error:.6f}")
print(f"R-squared (R¬≤): {r_squared:.4f}")
```

*Sample Output*:

```
Mean Squared Error (MSE): 0.000045
Mean Absolute Error (MAE): 0.003500
Correlation Coefficient: 0.9800
Tracking Error: 0.002200
R-squared (R¬≤): 0.9600
```

**Visualization**

Plot the cumulative returns of the index and the replicating portfolio for a visual comparison.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Calculate cumulative returns
cumulative_index = (1 + aligned_index_returns).cumprod()
cumulative_portfolio = (1 + portfolio_returns).cumprod()

plt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))
plt.plot(cumulative_index, label='S&P 500')
plt.plot(cumulative_portfolio, label='Replicating Portfolio')
plt.title('Cumulative Returns Comparison')
plt.xlabel('Date')
plt.ylabel('Cumulative Returns')
plt.legend()
plt.show()
```

*Notes*:

- **Interpretation**: The closer the portfolio's cumulative returns are to the index's, the more effective the replication.
- **Adjustments**: If performance is subpar, consider adjusting `n_nonzero_coefs`, reevaluating selected stocks, or revisiting inequality constraints.
