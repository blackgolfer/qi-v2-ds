## 1. Understanding the Concepts

### 1.1. Stock Index Replication with Inequality Constraints

**Stock Index Replication** involves creating a portfolio that mirrors the performance of a target index (e.g., S&P 500) using a subset of its constituent stocks. While **exact replication** (holding all constituent stocks in their exact proportions) ensures perfect tracking, it can be cost-prohibitive and impractical for large indices. Therefore, **approximate replication** with **inequality constraints** is often preferred, allowing for:

- **Reduced Portfolio Size**: Selecting a representative subset of stocks.
- **Cost Efficiency**: Lower transaction and maintenance costs.
- **Flexibility**: Incorporating investment constraints like sector diversification, maximum/minimum stock weights, etc.

### 1.2. Matching Pursuit (MP) Algorithm

**Matching Pursuit** is a greedy algorithm used for **sparse approximation**. It iteratively selects the element (atom) from a dictionary that best correlates with the current residual, updating the residual by subtracting the contribution of the selected atom. In stock index replication:

- **Dictionary**: Set of all constituent stocks' return vectors.
- **Signal**: Target index's return vector.
- **Atoms**: Individual stock's return vector.

**Goal**: Select a minimal set of stocks with optimal weights to approximate the index's returns.

**Advantages**:

- **Sparsity**: Achieves representation with few stocks.
- **Efficiency**: Computationally less intensive compared to exhaustive search methods.

### 1.3. Finite State Machines (FSM)

**Finite State Machines (FSMs)** are computational models used to design algorithms based on states and transitions. In portfolio management:

- **States**: Different portfolio conditions or market regimes (e.g., bullish, bearish, neutral).
- **Transitions**: Rules that dictate movement between states based on inputs or events (e.g., market indicators).

**Multiple Time-Scale FSM** involves managing FSMs operating at different temporal resolutions (e.g., daily, weekly, monthly) to capture both short-term fluctuations and long-term trends.

### 1.4. Multi-Time-Scale Analysis

**Multi-Time-Scale Analysis** examines data at various temporal resolutions to capture patterns that manifest across different horizons. For instance:

- **Short-Term (e.g., Minutes, Hours)**: Capturing high-frequency trading signals.
- **Medium-Term (e.g., Days, Weeks)**: Identifying intra-month trends.
- **Long-Term (e.g., Months, Years)**: Understanding macroeconomic influences and sustained trends.

Analyzing multiple time scales allows for a more nuanced understanding of market dynamics, enabling better-informed decision-making.

## 2. Designing the Combined Framework

### 2.1. Framework Overview

The objective is to create a system that:

1. **Approximates** a stock index using a subset of its constituents via Matching Pursuit, adhering to inequality constraints.
2. **Manages** portfolio weight adjustments (overweighting and underweighting) based on multiple time-scale FSMs that respond to different market conditions.

**Workflow**:

1. **Data Preparation**: Collect and preprocess OHLC data.
2. **Sparse Approximation**: Apply MP to select representative stocks and initial weights.
3. **State Management**: Utilize FSMs across multiple time scales to monitor market conditions.
4. **Weight Adjustments**: Based on FSM states, overweight or underweight certain stocks to align with the target index's performance.
5. **Evaluation**: Backtest and assess the portfolio's performance.

### 2.2. Defining FSM States and Transitions

**States**: Define distinct market regimes that influence portfolio weighting strategies. For example:

- **Bullish**: Market is trending upwards.
- **Bearish**: Market is trending downwards.
- **Sideways/Consolidation**: Market is stable with no clear trend.
- **Volatile**: High market volatility.
- **Stable**: Low market volatility.

**Transitions**: Establish rules that dictate when the portfolio should shift from one state to another based on indicators or signals.

**Multiple Time Scales**: Assign different FSMs to manage states at various time scales:

- **Short-Term FSM** (e.g., hourly): Detects rapid market changes.
- **Medium-Term FSM** (e.g., daily): Identifies intra-week trends.
- **Long-Term FSM** (e.g., weekly/monthly): Captures overarching market trends.

---

## 3. Implementing Matching Pursuit for Sparse Approximation

### 3.1. Preparing the Data

**Data Requirements**:

- **Historical Returns**: Daily or intra-day returns for the target index and constituent stocks.
- **Time Alignment**: Ensure all return series are synchronized temporally.

**Calculating Returns**:

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

# Example function to calculate daily returns
def calculate_returns(df):
    return df.pct_change().dropna()

# Calculate returns
index_returns = calculate_returns(index_data['Close'])
constituent_returns = calculate_returns(combined_constituent_data)
```

### 3.2. Applying MP to Select Stocks

**Objective**: Select a subset of stocks and determine their weights to approximate the target index's returns.

**Implementation Steps**:

1. **Standardize Data**: Normalize return vectors to ensure comparability.
2. **Initialize Residual**: Start with the target index's return vector.
3. **Iterative Selection**:
   - Identify the stock most correlated with the current residual.
   - Assign optimal weight to the selected stock.
   - Update the residual by subtracting the selected stock's weighted returns.
4. **Termination**: Stop when the residual's norm is below a threshold or after selecting a predefined number of stocks.

**Code Example**:

```python
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
import numpy as np

# Standardize returns
scaler = StandardScaler()
index_std = scaler.fit_transform(index_returns.values.reshape(-1, 1)).flatten()
constituent_std = scaler.transform(constituent_returns).T  # Shape: (num_stocks, num_days)

# Initialize residual
residual = index_std.copy()
selected_stocks = []
weights = []

# Define number of stocks to select or residual threshold
max_stocks = 10
residual_threshold = 0.1  # Adjust based on requirements

for _ in range(max_stocks):
    # Compute correlations
    correlations = np.dot(constituent_std, residual)
    
    # Select the stock with the highest absolute correlation
    best_stock_idx = np.argmax(np.abs(correlations))
    best_stock = constituent_returns.columns[best_stock_idx]
    
    # Compute optimal weight (using least squares)
    best_stock_returns = constituent_std[best_stock_idx]
    weight = np.dot(residual, best_stock_returns) / np.dot(best_stock_returns, best_stock_returns)
    
    # Append to selected stocks and weights
    selected_stocks.append(best_stock)
    weights.append(weight)
    
    # Update residual
    residual -= weight * best_stock_returns
    
    # Check residual norm
    residual_norm = np.linalg.norm(residual)
    if residual_norm < residual_threshold:
        break

print("Selected Stocks:", selected_stocks)
print("Weights:", weights)
```

**Notes**:

- **Constraints**: Incorporate inequality constraints (e.g., weight limits) during weight assignment.
- **Normalization**: After weight assignment, ensure that the portfolio weights sum to 1 or adhere to predefined constraints.

---

## 4. Designing Multiple Time-Scale FSM for Portfolio Management

### 4.1. Defining Time Scales

Determine the different time scales at which the FSMs will operate. For example:

- **Short-Term**: 1-hour intervals (detecting rapid market changes).
- **Medium-Term**: Daily intervals (identifying intra-week trends).
- **Long-Term**: Weekly or monthly intervals (capturing macro trends).

### 4.2. Creating FSM for Each Time Scale

**State Definitions**:

- **Bullish**: Indicators suggest an upward trend.
- **Bearish**: Indicators suggest a downward trend.
- **Sideways**: Market lacks a clear trend.
- **Volatile**: High volatility indicators.
- **Stable**: Low volatility indicators.

**Example FSM for a Single Time Scale Using `transitions` Library**:

```python
from transitions import Machine

class MarketFSM:
    states = ['bullish', 'bearish', 'sideways', 'volatile', 'stable']
    
    def __init__(self):
        self.machine = Machine(model=self, states=MarketFSM.states, initial='stable')
        
        # Define transitions
        self.machine.add_transition(trigger='to_bullish', source=['bearish', 'sideways', 'volatile', 'stable'], dest='bullish')
        self.machine.add_transition(trigger='to_bearish', source=['bullish', 'sideways', 'volatile', 'stable'], dest='bearish')
        self.machine.add_transition(trigger='to_sideways', source=['bullish', 'bearish', 'volatile', 'stable'], dest='sideways')
        self.machine.add_transition(trigger='to_volatile', source=['bullish', 'bearish', 'sideways', 'stable'], dest='volatile')
        self.machine.add_transition(trigger='to_stable', source=['bullish', 'bearish', 'sideways', 'volatile'], dest='stable')
```

**Initializing FSMs for Multiple Time Scales**:

```python
import copy

# Create FSM instances for different time scales
short_term_fsm = MarketFSM()
medium_term_fsm = MarketFSM()
long_term_fsm = MarketFSM()
```

---

## 5. Integrating MP Results with FSM for Weight Adjustments

### 5.1. Overweighting and Underweighting Mechanism

**Objective**: Adjust the weights of selected stocks based on the current state of each FSM to better align with the target index under different market conditions.

**Strategies**:

- **Overweighting**: Allocate higher weights to stocks that are leading indicators during bullish states.
- **Underweighting**: Allocate lower weights to stocks that are lagging or underperforming during bearish states.
- **Sector Rotation**: Shift weights favoring certain sectors based on FSM-determined states.

### 5.2. FSM Decision Logic Based on Time Scales

**Combining FSMs Across Time Scales**:

1. **State Aggregation**: Combine states from different time-scale FSMs to form a comprehensive market condition profile.
   
   - Example:
     - **Short-Term**: `bullish`
     - **Medium-Term**: `sideways`
     - **Long-Term**: `bullish`
   
2. **Decision Rules**: Define how combined FSM states influence portfolio weight adjustments.
   
   - **Example Rules**:
     - If any FSM indicates `volatile`, reduce overall portfolio exposure.
     - If both short-term and long-term FSMs indicate `bullish`, increase overweighting in selected stocks.
     - If medium-term FSM indicates `bearish`, adjust weights to underweight certain sectors.

**Implementation Concept**:

```python
def adjust_weights_based_on_fsm(fsm_states):
    # fsm_states: dict with keys as time scales and values as current state
    short_state = fsm_states['short']
    medium_state = fsm_states['medium']
    long_state = fsm_states['long']
    
    # Initialize adjustment factor
    adjustment_factor = 1.0
    
    # Define adjustment rules
    if 'volatile' in fsm_states.values():
        adjustment_factor *= 0.9  # Reduce exposure during high volatility
    
    if short_state == 'bullish' and long_state == 'bullish':
        adjustment_factor *= 1.1  # Increase exposure during strong bullish trends
    
    if medium_state == 'bearish':
        adjustment_factor *= 0.95  # Slightly reduce exposure during bearish mid-term trends
    
    return adjustment_factor
```

---

## 6. Implementation in Python

### 6.1. Setting Up the Environment

**Install Required Libraries**:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn ta ccxt xstate
```

*Note*: Replace `xstate` with `transitions` if `xstate` is not available or appropriate.

### 6.2. Implementing the MP Algorithm

**MP Implementation with Constraints**:

Extend the earlier MP implementation to include inequality constraints during weight assignment.

```python
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
import numpy as np

# Standardize returns
scaler = StandardScaler()
index_std = scaler.fit_transform(index_returns.values.reshape(-1, 1)).flatten()
constituent_std = scaler.transform(constituent_returns).T  # Shape: (num_stocks, num_days)

# Initialize residual
residual = index_std.copy()
selected_stocks = []
weights = []

# Define constraints
max_stocks = 10
residual_threshold = 0.1
max_weight = 0.05  # 5% max per stock
min_weight = 0.01  # 1% min per stock

for _ in range(max_stocks):
    # Compute correlations
    correlations = np.dot(constituent_std, residual)
    
    # Select the stock with the highest absolute correlation
    best_stock_idx = np.argmax(np.abs(correlations))
    best_stock = constituent_returns.columns[best_stock_idx]
    
    # Compute optimal weight (using least squares)
    best_stock_returns = constituent_std[best_stock_idx]
    weight = np.dot(residual, best_stock_returns) / np.dot(best_stock_returns, best_stock_returns)
    
    # Apply constraints
    weight = np.clip(weight, min_weight, max_weight)
    
    # Append to selected stocks and weights
    selected_stocks.append(best_stock)
    weights.append(weight)
    
    # Update residual
    residual -= weight * best_stock_returns
    
    # Check residual norm
    residual_norm = np.linalg.norm(residual)
    if residual_norm < residual_threshold:
        break

print("Selected Stocks:", selected_stocks)
print("Weights:", weights)
```

**Notes**:

- **Clipping Weights**: Ensures that no stock exceeds the maximum or falls below the minimum weight.
- **Constraint Adjustments**: Modify `max_weight`, `min_weight`, `max_stocks`, and `residual_threshold` based on investment policy.

### 6.3. Implementing the Multi-Time-Scale FSM

**Using `transitions` Library for FSM Implementation**:

```python
from transitions import Machine

class PortfolioFSM:
    states = ['bullish', 'bearish', 'sideways', 'volatile', 'stable']
    
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
        self.state = 'stable'  # Initial state
        self.machine = Machine(model=self, states=PortfolioFSM.states, initial='stable')
        
        # Define transitions based on simplified rules
        self.machine.add_transition(trigger='update_state', source='*', dest='bullish', conditions='is_bullish')
        self.machine.add_transition(trigger='update_state', source='*', dest='bearish', conditions='is_bearish')
        self.machine.add_transition(trigger='update_state', source='*', dest='sideways', conditions='is_sideways')
        self.machine.add_transition(trigger='update_state', source='*', dest='volatile', conditions='is_volatile')
        self.machine.add_transition(trigger='update_state', source='*', dest='stable', conditions='is_stable')
    
    # Define conditions (simplified for illustration)
    def is_bullish(self, data):
        return data['trend'] == 'bullish'
    
    def is_bearish(self, data):
        return data['trend'] == 'bearish'
    
    def is_sideways(self, data):
        return data['trend'] == 'sideways'
    
    def is_volatile(self, data):
        return data['volatility'] > self.threshold  # Define threshold appropriately
    
    def is_stable(self, data):
        return data['volatility'] <= self.threshold and data['trend'] == 'steady'
```

**Initializing FSMs for Different Time Scales**:

```python
# Initialize FSM instances
short_term_fsm = PortfolioFSM('short_term')
medium_term_fsm = PortfolioFSM('medium_term')
long_term_fsm = PortfolioFSM('long_term')
```

**Note**: Customize state transition conditions (`is_bullish`, `is_bearish`, etc.) based on relevant indicators for each time scale.

### 6.4. Integrating MP with FSM

**Workflow Integration**:

1. **MP Selection**: Select a subset of stocks and assign initial weights using MP.
2. **FSM State Detection**: At each time scale, determine the current market state using FSMs based on indicators.
3. **Weight Adjustment**: Modify the portfolio's weights based on FSM states to overweight or underweight certain stocks or sectors.

**Implementation Steps**:

```python
# Example function to adjust weights based on FSM states
def adjust_portfolio_weights(selected_stocks, weights, fsm_states, sector_info):
    """
    Adjust portfolio weights based on FSM states across multiple time scales.
    
    Parameters:
    - selected_stocks: list of selected stock tickers
    - weights: list of current weights
    - fsm_states: dict with keys as time scales and values as current FSM states
    - sector_info: dict mapping stock tickers to their sectors
    
    Returns:
    - adjusted_weights: list of adjusted weights
    """
    # Initialize adjusted weights
    adjusted_weights = weights.copy()
    
    # Example adjustment factors
    overweight_factor = 1.05
    underweight_factor = 0.95
    
    # Define which states trigger overweighting or underweighting
    # This is a simplified example; real strategies should be more nuanced
    if 'short_term' in fsm_states:
        if fsm_states['short_term'] == 'bullish':
            for i, stock in enumerate(selected_stocks):
                # Overweight stocks in certain sectors during bullish short-term
                if sector_info[stock] == 'Technology':
                    adjusted_weights[i] *= overweight_factor
        elif fsm_states['short_term'] == 'bearish':
            for i, stock in enumerate(selected_stocks):
                # Underweight stocks in certain sectors during bearish short-term
                if sector_info[stock] == 'Finance':
                    adjusted_weights[i] *= underweight_factor
    
    if 'medium_term' in fsm_states:
        if fsm_states['medium_term'] == 'volatile':
            # Diversify weights or reduce concentration
            total_weight = sum(adjusted_weights)
            adjusted_weights = [w / total_weight for w in adjusted_weights]
    
    if 'long_term' in fsm_states:
        if fsm_states['long_term'] == 'bullish':
            for i, stock in enumerate(selected_stocks):
                # Allocate more to growth sectors
                if sector_info[stock] == 'Healthcare':
                    adjusted_weights[i] *= overweight_factor
        elif fsm_states['long_term'] == 'bearish':
            for i, stock in enumerate(selected_stocks):
                # Allocate less to cyclical sectors
                if sector_info[stock] == 'Consumer Discretionary':
                    adjusted_weights[i] *= underweight_factor
    
    # Normalize weights to sum to 1
    total = sum(adjusted_weights)
    adjusted_weights = [w / total for w in adjusted_weights]
    
    return adjusted_weights
```

**Notes**:

- **Sector Information**: Maintain a mapping from stock tickers to their respective sectors to facilitate sector-based weighting adjustments.
  
  ```python
  sector_info = {
      'AAPL': 'Technology',
      'MSFT': 'Technology',
      'JPM': 'Finance',
      # Add all selected stocks
  }
  ```
  
- **Adjustment Logic**: Customize the adjustment logic based on your investment strategy and market condition interpretations.
  
- **Weight Normalization**: Always ensure that adjusted weights sum to 1 (or your desired portfolio total), maintaining portfolio consistency.

### 6.5. Example Code

Here‚Äôs a comprehensive example combining MP with FSM-based weight adjustments:

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from transitions import Machine
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Define Portfolio FSM using transitions library
class PortfolioFSM:
    states = ['bullish', 'bearish', 'sideways', 'volatile', 'stable']
    
    def __init__(self, name, threshold=1.0):
        self.name = name
        self.state = 'stable'  # Initial state
        self.threshold = threshold  # Example threshold for volatility
        self.machine = Machine(model=self, states=PortfolioFSM.states, initial='stable')

    def is_stable(self, data):
        return data['volatility'] <= self.threshold and data['trend'] == 'stable'

    # Simple moving averages for trend detection
    short_ma = return_series.rolling(window=5).mean()
    long_ma = return_series.rolling(window=20).mean()
    
    # Simple volatility measure
    volatility = return_series.rolling(window=20).std()
    
    last_short_ma = short_ma.iloc[-1]
    last_long_ma = long_ma.iloc[-1]
    last_volatility = volatility.iloc[-1]
    
    # Determine trend

    else:
        trend = 'stable'
    
    # Simple sideways condition
    if abs(last_short_ma - last_long_ma) < 0.001:
        trend = 'sideways'
    
    return {'trend': trend, 'volatility': last_volatility}

**Explanation of the Example Code**:

1. **Data Mocking**: For demonstration purposes, synthetic return data is generated. In a real-world scenario, replace this with actual OHLC data.

2. **Matching Pursuit with Constraints**:

   - **Standardization**: Ensures that all return series are on the same scale.
   - **Residual Initialization**: Starts with the target index's standardized returns.
   - **Iterative Selection**: Selects the stock with the highest absolute correlation with the residual and assigns it a weight within `[min_weight, max_weight]`.
   - **Residual Update**: Adjusts the residual by subtracting the selected stock's contribution.

3. **FSM Implementation**:

   - **PortfolioFSM Class**: Defines an FSM with states and transition triggers based on market conditions.
   - **Market State Determination**: Uses moving averages and volatility to classify the current market state.
   - **Multiple FSMs**: Separate FSMs can be instantiated for short-term, medium-term, and long-term time scales.

4. **Weight Adjustment**:

   - **Function `adjust_portfolio_weights`**: Modifies the initial weights based on the current states of the FSMs. For instance, overweighting technology stocks during bullish short-term states.

5. **Visualization**:

   - **Plotting Cumulative Returns**: Compares the performance of the replicating portfolio against the target index.

**Customization**:

- **Enhanced Indicators**: Incorporate more sophisticated indicators for state determination (e.g., RSI, MACD).
  
- **Sector Diversification**: Refine sector-based adjustment rules to cover all portfolio sectors.
  
- **Dynamic Thresholds**: Allow FSM thresholds to adapt based on historical volatility or other metrics.

## 7. Backtesting and Evaluation

### 7.1. Defining Performance Metrics

Evaluate the replicating portfolio's performance using metrics such as:

- **Cumulative Returns**: Total return over a period.
- **Tracking Error**: Standard deviation of the difference between portfolio and index returns.
- **Sharpe Ratio**: Risk-adjusted return.
- **Maximum Drawdown**: Largest peak-to-trough decline.
- **Alpha and Beta**: Measures relative to the target index.

### 7.2. Conducting Backtests

Backtesting involves simulating the portfolio's performance using historical data to assess how it would have performed under past market conditions.

**Steps**:

1. **Historical Data Window**: Define the period for backtesting (e.g., past 3 years).
2. **Iterative Portfolio Construction**: At each step, select stocks using MP, adjust weights via FSMs, and record performance.
3. **Rolling Window Analysis**: Use a rolling window to periodically update portfolio selections and weights.

**Code Sketch**:

```python
def backtest_portfolio(index_returns, constituent_returns, sector_info, parameters):
    # Initialize portfolio
    portfolio = pd.Series(index=index_returns.index, dtype=float)
    portfolio_weights = {}
    
    for current_date in index_returns.index:
        # Define the historical window (e.g., past 60 days)
        window_start = current_date - pd.Timedelta(days=60)
        window_end = current_date
        
        # Extract historical returns
        index_window = index_returns.loc[window_start:window_end]
        constituent_window = constituent_returns.loc[window_start:window_end]
        
        # Apply MP to select stocks
        selected_stocks, weights = apply_matching_pursuit(index_window, constituent_window, parameters)
        
        # Determine market states
        fsm_states = determine_fsm_states(index_window, parameters)
        
        # Adjust weights based on FSM states
        adjusted_weights = adjust_portfolio_weights(selected_stocks, weights, fsm_states, sector_info)
        
        # Record weights
        portfolio_weights[current_date] = adjusted_weights
        
        # Calculate portfolio return
        portfolio.loc[current_date] = (constituent_returns[selected_stocks].loc[current_date] * adjusted_weights).sum()
    
    # Calculate cumulative returns
    portfolio_cumulative = (1 + portfolio).cumprod() - 1
    index_cumulative = (1 + index_returns).cumprod() - 1
    
    # Plot performance
    plt.figure(figsize=(12,6))
    plt.plot(portfolio_cumulative, label='Replicating Portfolio')
    plt.plot(index_cumulative, label='Target Index', alpha=0.7)
    plt.legend()
    plt.title('Portfolio vs. Target Index Performance')
    plt.xlabel('Date')
    plt.ylabel('Cumulative Returns')
    plt.show()
    
    return portfolio, index_returns
```

### 7.3. Analyzing Results

Assess how closely the replicating portfolio tracks the target index:

- **Tracking Error**: Lower tracking error signifies better replication.
  
  ```python
  tracking_error = np.std(portfolio - index_returns)
  print(f"Tracking Error: {tracking_error:.4f}")
  ```
  
- **Sharpe Ratio**: Higher Sharpe ratio indicates better risk-adjusted performance.
  
  ```python
  sharpe_ratio = (portfolio.mean() / portfolio.std()) * np.sqrt(252)  # Annualized
  print(f"Sharpe Ratio: {sharpe_ratio:.4f}")
  ```
  
- **Maximum Drawdown**: Evaluate the largest decline from a peak.
  
  ```python
  def max_drawdown(cumulative_returns):
      peak = cumulative_returns.expanding(min_periods=1).max()
      drawdown = (cumulative_returns - peak) / peak
      return drawdown.min()
  
  mdd = max_drawdown(portfolio_cumulative)
  print(f"Maximum Drawdown: {mdd:.2%}")
  ```

## 8. Best Practices and Considerations

### 8.1. Parameter Selection

- **MP Parameters**: Adjust `max_stocks`, `residual_threshold`, `max_weight`, and `min_weight` based on historical performance and investment constraints.
  
- **FSM Thresholds**: Calibrate volatility thresholds and trend detection parameters to accurately reflect market conditions.

### 8.2. Risk Management

- **Diversification**: Ensure the portfolio is diversified across sectors to mitigate sector-specific risks.
  
- **Rebalancing Frequency**: Determine optimal rebalancing intervals to balance responsiveness and transaction costs.
  
- **Stop-Loss Mechanisms**: Implement rules to limit losses during adverse market conditions.

### 8.3. Model Validation

- **Out-of-Sample Testing**: Validate the model using data not seen during training to assess generalizability.
  
- **Stress Testing**: Simulate extreme market conditions to evaluate portfolio resilience.
  
- **Cross-Validation**: Use techniques like rolling cross-validation to ensure consistent performance.
