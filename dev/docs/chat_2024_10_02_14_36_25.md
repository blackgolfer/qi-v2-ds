# Reinforcement Learning - a basic setup with pytorch, guided from chart-gpt (vscode extension)
Sure! I can guide you through creating a basic reinforcement learning (RL) project using PyTorch, specifically focusing on stock market trading. This tutorial will be a high-level overview to help you understand the concepts and the coding process. 

### Overview of Steps

1. **Setting Up the Environment**
2. **Defining the Stock Trading Environment**
3. **Building the RL Agent**
4. **Training the Agent**
5. **Evaluating the Agent**
6. **Visualizing the Results**

### Step 1: Setting Up the Environment

First, make sure you have Python and the necessary libraries installed. You will need:

- Python (3.6 or above)
- PyTorch
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib (for visualization)
- OpenAI Gym (for the environment)

You can install them using pip:

```bash
pip install torch numpy pandas matplotlib gym
```

### Step 2: Defining the Stock Trading Environment

We'll define a simple stock trading environment using OpenAI Gym's interface. The agent will receive observations about the stock prices and will take actions like "buy," "sell," or "hold."

```python
import gym
import numpy as np

class StockTradingEnv(gym.Env):
    def __init__(self, data):
        super(StockTradingEnv, self).__init__()
        self.data = data
        self.current_step = 0
        self.action_space = gym.spaces.Discrete(3)  # 0: Hold, 1: Buy, 2: Sell
        self.observation_space = gym.spaces.Box(low=0, high=np.inf, shape=(1,), dtype=np.float32)

    def reset(self):
        self.current_step = 0
        return self.data[self.current_step]

    def step(self, action):
        current_price = self.data[self.current_step]
        self.current_step += 1

        if action == 1:  # Buy
            reward = self.data[self.current_step] - current_price
        elif action == 2:  # Sell
            reward = current_price - self.data[self.current_step]
        else:  # Hold
            reward = 0

        done = self.current_step >= len(self.data) - 1
        return self.data[self.current_step], reward, done, {}

    def render(self):
        # You can add visualization logic here
        pass
```

### Step 3: Building the RL Agent

For simplicity, we will use a basic Q-learning algorithm to create our RL agent. PyTorch will be used for the neural network.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

class QNetwork(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, state_size, action_size):
        super(QNetwork, self).__init__()
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(state_size, 24)
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(24, 24)
        self.fc3 = nn.Linear(24, action_size)

    def forward(self, x):
        x = torch.relu(self.fc1(x))
        x = torch.relu(self.fc2(x))
        return self.fc3(x)

class Agent:
    def __init__(self, state_size, action_size):
        self.model = QNetwork(state_size, action_size)
        self.optimizer = optim.Adam(self.model.parameters(), lr=0.001)
        self.criterion = nn.MSELoss()

    def get_action(self, state):
        if np.random.rand() < epsilon:  # Explore
            return np.random.choice(action_size)
        else:  # Exploit
            with torch.no_grad():
                return torch.argmax(self.model(torch.FloatTensor(state))).item()

    def train(self, state, action, reward, next_state, done):
        target = reward + (1 - done) * discount_factor * torch.max(self.model(torch.FloatTensor(next_state)))
        output = self.model(torch.FloatTensor(state))[action]
        loss = self.criterion(output, target)
        
        self.optimizer.zero_grad()
        loss.backward()
        self.optimizer.step()
```

### Step 4: Training the Agent

Now, we will create a loop to train the agent over multiple episodes.

```python
import random

# Hyperparameters
num_episodes = 1000
epsilon = 1.0
epsilon_decay = 0.995
epsilon_min = 0.01
discount_factor = 0.99

env = StockTradingEnv(data=np.random.rand(100))  # Use actual stock data
agent = Agent(state_size=1, action_size=3)

for episode in range(num_episodes):
    state = env.reset()
    done = False

    while not done:
        action = agent.get_action(state)
        next_state, reward, done, _ = env.step(action)
        
        agent.train(state, action, reward, next_state, done)
        state = next_state

    epsilon = max(epsilon_min, epsilon * epsilon_decay)
```

### Step 5: Evaluating the Agent

After the training, you'll want to evaluate the agent's performance:

```python
state = env.reset()
done = False
total_reward = 0

while not done:
    action = agent.get_action(state)
    next_state, reward, done, _ = env.step(action)
    total_reward += reward
    state = next_state

print(f"Total Reward: {total_reward}")
```

### Step 6: Visualizing the Results

You can visualize the agent's performance over time using Matplotlib. This will typically involve plotting the cumulative rewards or the stock price trajectory alongside the agent's actions.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Assuming you have a list of rewards
plt.plot(reward_list)
plt.xlabel('Episode')
plt.ylabel('Total Reward')
plt.title('Agent Performance over Episodes')
plt.show()
```

### Conclusion

This is a very basic stock trading RL agent using Q-learning and PyTorch. The agent is trained to make actions based on stock price movements. This example can be significantly improved with more advanced techniques like Deep Q-Learning (DQN), Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), or adding more features/indicators into the state representation.
